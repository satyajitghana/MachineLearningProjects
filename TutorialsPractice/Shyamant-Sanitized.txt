Hey Whts the model no of ur calculator?
Thnx
Hey after running powertop --calibrate
And can u send the commands to be run after installing tlp?
After powertops calibrate?
Ok thnx!
Oh and how did u change how the icons and all look?
Ok thnx
üòÇ
So basically it's the number of 5's that appear when u find the factors of the number?
10! Has two zeroes but u can divide 10 by 5 only once...
???
Ya no idea
Whts the ans?
Oh ans is on top
Wth?
Wait lemme do in pc
Nothing else at least in the hematite exp
There r dll and .o files in python I guess it has something to do with that?(those files r there in the windows version not sure about Linux)
üëçüèª
Only the first one
Not sure hv to ask ma'am Tomo
Not yet
Did u get tower of Hanoi?
Chirag told to think in a mathematical way
I'm still stuck
And no arrays it seems
So I'm even more stuck
üëçüèª
üò≥üòü
Ask chirag he'll probably hv the link
The Hindi ones were from code ninja
how do u choose which disk move will be the most optimal one?
Base case chirag told...he said it depends on input
But that'll be human thinking
Oh
Ys
Ya
Ya
üòÇ
I gv up, saw a video from geekforgeeks and the soln is hilariousüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ya I finished keypad
//m.youtube.com/watch?v=YstLjLCGmgg
Hey wht did u write for analysis and discussion for first exp?
Or just send a pic
Nm I wrote something off
I left long back
Crap
I'm asking chirag if there's another way
How did u get it??
Wow Thnx I told chirag he still has to reply
Ur still there??
He said the pic is fine
But
The college is in kengri it seems and if it's not near peenya we can't go to the college and then go there...I hv to go to the college tomorrow since I hv tht sheet with me
Ya it's possible I can leave the sheet with sambar after cross checking in the morning
*sanibar
The other CR
Stupid autocorrect
Nineleaps?
No wht is it
Nope
Whts the former? I don't hv the message
I'm not coming tomo...not feeling well
Did u give attendance for comp lab? Even I forgot...can u try asking ma'am to give attendance?
//m.youtube.com/watch?v=i7sm9dzFtEI
Got attendance?
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I don't understand at allüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dude tomo chem lab rite
Lol chuck it
They took it?
üòì
How do u do the mean value theorem pdf excercises q 2 and 4 on the lmvt part?
I got 4...I want to cross check the 2nd one
And the 3rd of rolled theorem
Ya same
Ya I still don't get it
I don't understand the hibt
In the 3rd of rolled we hv to prove tht the function goes to 0 at some point c
And at that point slope is x axis
Parallel to x axis
Ya
But how do u prove it?
How do u just assume stuff like thay
This is not needed I think
This part
Oh ya
Technically g(0)=g(1) that's all not necessarily 0
Oh
OK how do u assume this
Assume it's rite noe? It's already proved offüëçüèª
Especially the f'(x)=f(x) part
OK assuming the hint how do u get this? Once u get this u get the ans
Ok
How do u do this?
U should use mesh analysis
Mesh analysis is used to find loop current whereas kvl is used to find branch current
There's a duf
Nope
Sayan guy doesn't hv?
Ayiooo
The shop near college might hv
Ask shubham where he got his
After comp u can buy a cheap one
üëçüèª
?
OK got same
Ikr
Is it like potential across A and B is potential across 12 ohm?
I=2A?
The current sources thing
And will the current source affect the voltage across the 12 ohm resistor?
OK so how do u find it?
Source transformation?
Finding load current
Using thevenin's theorem
Then?I'm
*then
Current sources are in parallel here
If they are in series then also add?
V=10/3
Oh ya
Now what?
Vth is 30?
Open circuit noe when finding vth
??
This step ya
And rth also
Forget it it's too Complicated
I think it's right...u simplify the entire circuit to this and then do everything
To this to be exact
And now start applying thevenin's theorem
Aey the slides in the cd and the slides which he uses r dif
Till slide 13/15 I think
?
Ans Is b
Idk that's the ans written
Hey u going tomo?
Aey tomo business is there
I don't want to go to college
U live near ish so it's fine
Going
Dude it's waaaay too big
Somethings wrong with my Ubuntu
Asked chirag he said malware
God noes
Safe resetting -> booting into safe mode and doing something
To go to safe mode goto grub menu, advanced options and select recovery mode...now waiting for chirag to reply
Hey how do u access Ubuntu partition from windows? I want to backup atleast my assignment
Tty thingy I can
Oh I just copy it from there rite?
Nm
Ya
üòÖ
Tried it...ended up logging me out for no reasob
Wth...now everything is fine...I booted into Ubuntu and everything came back
Idk whts going on
The change i notice is tht the third party fix which I put for the wifi driver is gone
I did...thrice
I did tht but it was like run some dpkg configure command or whtnot...I did that before contacting chirag and the safe mode thingy
I did it in TTY
Whts TTY full form?
Typewriter???
Woah
Holy crap
Hey how do I install gdm themes? I got one nice one from one website called gnome-look.org but it's an archive...no idea wht to do
Where?
Remember I told u tht my pc took a long time to reboot? After the whole icon thing tht got fixed for some reason
Basically wherever u put Ant u should put the theme name rite?
Ant is a theme right?
Gdm tgene
Themr
Theme
Ayioo ik
In this context
Insect
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Seriously?? U still dint get it?
Ya keep it simple
Isn't x code the apple thingy?
But isn't it only for Mac?
It's there on Linux?
U hv Mac?
Oh
Hackintosh
Ya tht
I still dint see it...I don't think I'll attend the session...my grandfather is at the hospital...
I'll log in to discord to get the attendance points
Wht string functions u used to check for spam? Actually wht string functions are there in C?
But how did u find the spam words in the mail?
There is no direct find function?
Holy shit
Holy shit again
Dint u finish it?
Wait so u dint finish the entire thing
I'll go home and check...at grand parents house now
Hey u hv an office activator?
Can u send it to me?
Ok
Got Matlab R2017a for linux
Hey whts the ans for the resistance u got for this q?
Not rx...after simplifying the stuff
//linuxtor.org/155-mathworks-matlab-r2017a.html
Link has magnet link
The word is short circuited
I used a lot of Star-delta stuff
Ya
And in urs, where did the top 12 ohm and top 6 ohm go?
Nm
It's Matlab
Or simulink to be exact
Ignore the scope and shit
Like in a normal circuit, where do I place the voltmeter and ammeter so that I can find the load resistance?
So Thts rite? Wht I did
The voltage and current measurement thingy are the meters
It's simplish
9.16 ohm
And wht did u use for the graph?
If u double click scope it'll show u graph
Desmos?
Oh
üëçüèª
Nope...one of the matlab ones is like comp...finding element in an array and gettinh its index
They haven‚Äôt asked for time complexity so don‚Äôt scare me...I don‚Äôt want to explain tht stuff
I‚Äôll google some complicated algo and use itüòõ
Then how do u find out the time taken by ur method and the find method? Some inbuilt thing is there in Matlab?
Oh
Still thts not related to math...it‚Äôs more like a comp question
Wht formula used?
10+35+20 is not 70
In the figure 3, u add X and Y to get total voltage?
Ok thanks
Wait
Huh?
In the figure in the q, there are parts left hanging loose(dont now wht u call them in PCBs) so how to represent them in the diagram
So don‚Äôt draw them in the circuit?
Ok I‚Äôll crop it off then
Thanks
Why would it change?
How do u calculate it using the Vth^2/4Rl formula? I used urs and I got a different answer
How?
U end up simplifying the circuit completely rite?
Ya I got it using urs but how do u apply thevenin's theorem?
And u hv to apply thevenin's theorem to find Rx in the first place
Wait whts the ans? Like power thing is not given in the pic
U need to reduce the circuit to thevenin's equivalent circuit and the value of Rth u find out is the value of resistance for maximum power transfer...so u kinda need thevenin's theorem
I'll ask sir wht to do
Finished everything in electrical apart from the essay q
All the writing work done
Yup write essay ask this doubt to sir and update all the index and stuff and electrical over
Best is to ask sir
Ya
Idk can't think anymore
Thts all...comp did the writing part of 3qs
U?
U Finished everything except debates???????
üò±üò±üò±
üòµ
Wht u finished?
Tomo chem lab noe?
Chem or electrical?
Yaaa I think tomorrow is electrical
Shit
I hv to write
Which experiment we should write?
üòì
Ignore off...write wht we did
Dude that'll take time...I think
Oh ya...the one with the wrong resistor value
The dude gv us the wrong one
Tomo experiment is long it seems
The dude told noe
Ayioo I'll wrote something...he also said it was fine so leave...In the limitations I'll write something like non availability of required resistors or something
Oh ya dude how do we fill the table?
Ya best is to ask sir how to write this thing...u can't fill the table properly only
We hv three cases of values...and the table only has space for one
Ya
So r u writing something?
The experiment says to vary voltage
And there's nothing about maximum power transfer theorem...theory or calculations...in the manual
Actually
???
But no values?
I won't write anything...I'll ask sir wht to do
Ya noe
Pakka tomo electrical lab?
Oi send math
I dint write any part A's
Ya
It's there on the class group
Dude r u going for the debug thingy?
OK I'll also come then...tht interview thing is there noe?
Dude send chem and math
Wht compare function?
I wrote how there are many uses and all
üò≥
Not much at allüòìüòìüò∞
Wait u solved it???
Wth...
Chem and math?
Holy shit OK don't forget to send it
Thnx man
Math part b first q
*part
Velocity at what time?
Pi?
Thts a constant
-3pi/2
-3xpi/2
How did u get the 2pi^2 part
Huh?
Ya that
How did u get c=2pi^2?
I thought u used y=mx+c but I couldn't figure out how u got value of c
So u found displacement at time t=pi and equated it to 3xpi/2+c?
Ya
Idk...wait how the hell did u get the displacement at t=pi? Did u like get the displacement at that time using the distance function in the given in the q?
Second function is not given
So u need the function to find the function is wht ur saying
üò≥
U mean 1/2(t^2 + 5tsint)
...OK I got 2pi^2, but if u look at the graph, when t=pi, the distance isn't 2pi^2, it's around 4.9-5ish
So Is the graph wrong?
No like is the equi wrong
Why is there discrepancy?
Ya
Oh
Crap
Ok
Nm
Shit
Ya
üòÖ
C is y intercept
Dude can u send the doc file instead of pdf?
Nm...I found shortcut keys to write eqs do writing it is faster
How do u insert matrices of any size??
I needed the doc since I don't noe how to do this...converting from pdf to doc screwed up the formating and I ended up copying some matrix from somewhere and editing the valuesüòÇ
Ya but that's only pre-defined sizes
Like if I want 50x100 or something
Wait
OK nm
It's right
U went to college?
Can u send math?
Ya I got it
Some stupid thing I thought
Can u send math?
Wth u haven't reached yet?
Ayioo rama
Also send the comp one...I want to noe how u wrote the references...I don't have any references!
Or can u refer sites like quora and all?
U Finished civil?
üò≥üò≥üò≥
U r so chill...I'll dying in the essays
If I chuck doing the spam filter I can kind of relax...I hv civil and essays left but I really want to do spam filter
Hell no it'll be boring
im doing ulta
nope
only comp debate over
Have all the essays left except comp essay...finished it just now
And full civil
Thts why use paint
And in the electrical essay...everything is there in the slides only...can we write slides in references?
Dude how do u return a string in a function?
Dint start
spam filter program done!
Same functionality as urs, only flaw is tht the spam words can't have spaces...they should be only one word
Checked it?
How much did u finish in civil?
I literally dint start...starting tomo morning
Technically I thought I'll copy from ursüòõ
Hey send math and civil
How much is left for u?
That's a lot of ram usage
??
No like overall
All assignments
Shit I have to write algo for the spam filter...üò≥üò±üò∞
He solved it?
Mine?
Crap I now whts wrong
I basically check for spam stuff after the user enters mail content...since u added the spam word after entering the mail, when it checked the mail the word dint exist...
I'll change it wait
OK I can't do it without objects and classes (or structures)...I fixed the problem but I encountered one where if the same guy sends multiple mails I can't keep track of which mail is sent by which user...the arrays get messed up
So this is a limitation
This is the only q where I have proper limitations
U have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much time on ur hands
And I'm already sleepy
U can do it using dictionaries/mappings but objects/structures is better
Is it possible to make an array of a structure?
Oh good C is fine regarding that
Ohhhh
Damn u can't do this q without structures
It'll be waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to complicated
And hard to understand
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hey send civil and math when ur done
Holy when will u sleep?
Thts fine
Are our ans in math right? How did he solve the rolles theorem part?
Wth I'll use Newton raphson methodüëçüèª
U can use tht
Oiii, send math and civil
When did u sleep yesterday?
Or did u sleep today like 5 in the morning?
üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üò≥üòµ
I'll die if I sleep then...
Thanks for the assignments
Finished chem debate...doing phy debate
Civil full left
Math debate
Comp outputs
And all the index stuff and name writing things
üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Oh
It should be 45.9 for u
Only have civil and math debate left...u?
Lucky...
2 debates and comp spam prog
I'm hoping to do comp with structures but idk
Ya I write and think
Even though u gv me ur assignments I only read them and did everything by myself
Paint.net
The first q is messy
Hey send civil debate
Thnx
It isn't urs though...or did u change everything???
U used this?
References?
How the hell did u get them
Like how did u noe relevant stuff was written in the books?
Hey for the riemann sum thing, how did u get the graph? Like all the rectangles and all
Nope
We are in the cs department right?
Where?
Crap
Ya...
Does it give graph?
Oh ya good point
OK give me a func
X^4?I'm
Is fine?
OK then don't do that and print the rest we'll ask Maam
Or sir
Then write that
Best is to follow the pdf
Dude do u have the code for the desmos thing?
In Matlab the y axis labels are not small enough
I used that I got this graph
For the 1st q in part b, should we write the code for the graph? The question doesn't say to do so
Ya only cs pics left and index and stuff
U?
Dude I ended up getting a seg fault in my spam prog for some reason
Nm I fixed it...luckily I sent u the code before trying to fix that problem u found out
No clue...dint check the code I just rewrote the entire thingy (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V)
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I haven't installed any C stuff on windows...so Idk if it'll run on windows...I use Linux for programs
Hey did they give papers on Saturday?
üòì
Is any C compiler there by default in windows?
Ya
But God noes if it's as easy to use in Linux
Like via cmd
Oh wow one good thing about windows
Lol nm
üòÇüòÇ
Dude do we hv proctors?
Wth is tht fact function??üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Wht happened to the whts app group?
It's not factories?üòÇüòÇüòÇ
*factorial
U had proctor meeting?
Wht was it?
üò≥üò≥üò≥they think Thts high level???
üò≥üò≥üò≥
U got apron?
Input is the stuff the structure contains
Then an option which writes the current structure data to a file (as a structure using binary files? Idk)
Then another option which reads the full file and displays the contents of the file
Oh
Go to file
And see if it‚Äôs activated
Crack?
Like office crack
Ayioooo
Send cross over noe? Along with the crack
And office u got from where?
Ya it doesn‚Äôt
Crossover doesn‚Äôt work
Send the links where u got cross over and office nor
*noe
Wait the link I sent?
Linuxtor or something
Office also from there?
I give up
No crack for word
I‚Äôm not coming tomo...got feverüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
I don't get the experiment...most probably we should do it again
Lol
Tht experiment is beyond weird
Wait ur bunking lab????????
üò≥üò≥ how many people came?
What happened in the meeting?
The thing he told first?
üëçüèª
Downside is that I can't run PowerPoint and word at the same time, but that can be fixed easily in the script...I don't syntax tho
Another downside is that the virtual machine has to be in a saved state...Thts not exactly downside but ya
But definite downside is that battery will drain faster
Ya I need to add more ram...and I was thinking to chuck the cd drive and put an ssd with Mac on it...it's possible rite? Will the grub show option for Mac or should I change the boot order whenever I want to log into Mac?
Another downside is that alt-tabbing becomes weird...when word is focused, it alt-tabs through all the windows stuff, when any Linux app is focused, it alt-tabs through all the Linux appd
So wait, u can't install Mac os on ssds? Only hdds??
Win 7 takes very less ram...when running word it took only 600 or so mb
BSOD?
I faced purple screen of death...something had happened to my display itself...once I replaced it everything was fine
Windows and mac
Github username firekind
Fractal pattern dp huh?
Mandelbrot
Dude for the comp assignment second question b part, the input is just the roll numbers rite?
Crap structure
Hell no Thts long
I used structures üëçüèª
Understood pointers a bit more
Used qsort
Reg number is int
If I change to str and make some changes in the comparator function for the q sort it'll work
Nope doing 3rd q of comp now
In the mailing list thing, should we take the address as an input as well?
But a mailing list should have the address of the ppl...it's like common sense
In a way...but house number, which street and all u won't get to noe
Dint even see the other assignments qs
U going for any of the events?
Ur gonna stay till 12 in the morning???
I'm only going for the python thing
I dunno image processing and all
Dude I'll be coming really really late today
üò≥üò≥üò≥
how many people came?
For?
Ok
But ask on the group of anyone will come
Wth lucky
In 2.7, input() will try to guess the data type of the thing u entered. Not sure how it works in 3
In 2.7, there's a function called raw_input() which returns string
Same function as input
But in 2.7, there's a problem in using input()...say ur program is x=input("blah blah blah")
U can't
U hv to use raw_input
Thts why input() is not that encouraged
But this problem isn't there in 3.x
And there is no raw_input in 3.x

d(sinx)/dx is cos x
Idk ur confusing me
IE11?
So u can see deleted messages still
Dude the question itself is mis leading
U should‚Äôve written abt the risk in answering only 6qs
Idk how to
Whts a straw poll in the first place?
Ik poll but straw poll?
Before that, how many ppl even answered the poll?
Lol
LOL many ppl mute the group and keep...they don‚Äôt even see the messages
Which version of MATLAB will work on 1gb ram?

For math
The practice questions
Send wht u hv
Thnx
Ur own question?
Why don‚Äôt u put the Hamiltonian operator in it? It‚Äôll be much more interesting uk
The q makes no sense...is eq one and eq two part of the question or is it the answer or something?
U found out all the derivatives and did it...brute force approach

But doh what by doh x?
How do U even do that sum?
Or is it an implicit function?
Diff of ln x is 1/x noe?
So how is doh u/doh x=1/u times 3x^2-3yz?
Missed voice call
Then urs is wrong noe?
But urs is wrong right?
Maybe u=x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz
Ya then what do I do god noes
U said u=ln(stuff)
U definitely did something wrong
Second last step, how did u take (x+y+z) common?
Wait
I dint get anything wth did u do?
Whts this ?
Ok but wht did u do about the times u part???
Dude wht did u do?
Then?
I got this but I hv to see how u applied it in the ans
So u diff 3/(x+y+z) w.r.t x , y and z then added them? But wht happened to the square?
Ok
Ohhhh
Ok I got it
Thnx
üòÖ
Installed arch
Three times
And guess wht was the problem with the shutdown thing was
Do u have a video on installing gnome on arch?
It just crashed for me
Installed arch againüëçüèª this is the fourth timeüòÇ
Ok I‚Äôll ask u later
Can u ans this?
Ur here to kill ur laptop by capping its RAM and swap for no reason by using a small C program
Huh?

Installing was fun tho
I‚Äôll pakka fail tomoüëçüèª
I got this
It rhymes but Syu is like apt-update right?
üëçüèª
Done
Lol I hv to start
So during sem end I‚Äôll remove Ubuntu from my laptop and put arch
For college work ud prefer arch or Ubuntu?
Reason?
Ok thnx for the info
üëçüèª
Wht did u do?
Whts this new way of torturing ur laptop that u found?
üòÇwht a name
Send the code noe?
Logic seems wrong but where is the stack smasher?
Oh lol
When i=n-1 in the selection_sort for loop, ur sending i+1 to min function which becomes minIndex and that is returned from min function and passed to swap...but why dint u get seg fault...oh ya it doesn‚Äôt go inside the loop in the min function...üòÇüòÇüòÇüëåüèª
If u hv a string in a structure and u give it a value using scanf and all, if u want to change the value of that string u hv to use strcpy() noe?
-123/10=-12 noe?
That time -12<10
Base case is met before num of digits is 1
So u need abs
Ya that also will work
Ya urs it‚Äôs fine
Mine needs abs

0 is one digit long
No but 0 is 1 digit long...u write 0 on paper and it‚Äôs one digit right? Length of ‚Äú0‚Äù is 1 noe?
...
0 cannot hv zero digits...zero digits means it‚Äôs not a number but 0 is a number

Ok it‚Äôs decided...I‚Äôll put arch on my laptop...I‚Äôll give it around 70 Gn
*gb
Right after windows defragments C drive
Which will take god noes how long
So I‚Äôll triple boot my pc? Or tri boot?
Wait a sec...how do I do this?
Like I already hv grub...so how do I make grub noe that arch is there on the pc so please display it on the grub menu?
Do I need to run the grub-install command?
üëçüèª
Im using gparted to free space in my disk
Which is easy to use
Once thts done everything  else is same as the virtual box thing
And less scary
Finished electrical?
I‚Äôll do motor sums tomo morn
Everything else done
I‚Äôm just studying from slides
Which Shubham sent on group
And notes I took
üò≥üò≥üò≥
Wht derivations?
They aren‚Äôt derivations
Ik picturesüòÇ
So u want to give me a heart attack and send me to the hospital
Ya...25 marks q
WTH is j tho?
In the derivations
Same
üëçüèª
Windows takes too long to defrag
Sighhh
I dint want to lose data and it‚Äôs taking too long
The stupid thing finished nowüòÇüòÇ
For gparted, I need to download the live version iso and paste it into a usb noe? I don‚Äôt need to use rufus rite?
Damn ya I can do that
But it would be safer to not boot into anything and then partition the disk
Better to be safe than sorry
Moreover since I don‚Äôt hv an external hdd
Ya it should
I‚Äôll try it tomo
I do get that pop up, but even when I close WhatsApp I get notifications
The problem I had before was fixed in a WhatsApp update
Guess which shirt I‚Äôm wearing ü§£ü§£ü§£
Full marksüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
It‚Äôs this
I was looking into how to fix it when the laptop died
How do I use AUR? Like want to install the numix-circle-icon-theme and I found an AUR page
So how do I use it?
And how do u add repositories in arch?
Format?
No no In the Pacman.conf file, whts the way u hv to write the repo?
Wow thts useful
Ok
Woah ok
I‚Äôll learn slowly
No no
I‚Äôll learn how to use arch slowly
I‚Äôll do arch first
Since it‚Äôs lightweight
And it‚Äôs fast compared to Ubuntu
I mean fast
Like really fast
Why can‚Äôt Ubuntu be like that...üò≠
True
Ya and for some reason we learn ideal stuff
Ikr...it‚Äôs like our life was a lie till now
Stupid ideal gas eq
Don‚Äôt u need the size while using calloc/malloc? Like as an argument...just keep track of it noe??
So ur saying it only writes the pointer to the file and not the whole structure/array/whatever?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
If we use normal arrays it‚Äôll work?
Oh good
Use normal arrays then
üòÇüòÇ
Figured out why my battery drains even when pc is off
I think arch enabled wake-on lan, which basically lets someone switch on a pc if it‚Äôs connected to a network
So that features runs even when the pc is shutdown, and drains the battery
Turns out stuff was off
So idk
Dude there‚Äôs a puja at my house
It‚Äôs almost over so wait
Ok
Sorry about this
Got WiFi running on archüëçüèª
And icons
Tilix is taking some time...one of the dependencies (gtkd) is taking forever to install
Hey for PowerTOP In Ubuntu we do
In my Ubuntu, when I launch terminal it opens tilix...how did u do that?
Did u edit something
?
Managed to fix/suppress the PCIe bus error thing
Edited the /boot/grub/grub.cfg manually
In Ubuntu
Somehow found out where they add the cmd line args
Which idiot had a such a naming sense? WTH does vmlinuz even mean?
The narration part
Kannada Hindi
Learn Shubham‚Äôs
No I‚Äôll probably read my moms
I can‚Äôt understand hisüòÇ
Learn just in case
Shubham trans should be easy
Take print out and keep...u can read it also it‚Äôs fine
Hey I‚Äôll need ur help with zsh and powerline in arch
I‚Äôll be coming late...still stuck at tin factory
It‚Äôs not nimmis class it‚Äôs Chandan‚Äôs
And I‚Äôll kick u if u do that
He said he might take
Hopefully not
Text me which teacher will come
üëçüèª
What room number?
C504
Why r u asking?
Btw I‚Äôll end up skipping math
Dying in traffic
And I hv to come by metro
Why do u ppl talk and suddenly turn to me and start laughing?
Oi u tell
She won‚Äôt
I asked she dint
That only I did
Nope
I have my calc and only one calc...wait I‚Äôll check
I don‚Äôt have it
Lol what she taught?
Did she teach properly?
Chuck it I‚Äôll learn later...I‚Äôm dying in assignments
Did u finish the part b q1 and the car walla? I want to cross check my answer tomo
Ok I‚Äôll send u the assignment and u send me one
By afternoon I‚Äôll be able to finish typing the last one of math also
Dude do u hv the electrical readings?
Can u send? I want to give my elec lab manual tomo
I can‚Äôt...I won‚Äôt finish assignments then
Full?
Thanks bro
Which u have done
Btw assignments help üôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
I‚Äôll helpüëçüèª
Which qs?
Hey for the newton Ralph son q, wht do u mean by explain steps involved in the algorithm
Matlab code?
Oh
So not the codes algo?
Ok
Dude did u get the graph for the newton Ralph‚Äôs on? I‚Äôm getting error
And when I correct it I get a weird graph
What do u mean it won‚Äôt work?
And why the hell a contour plot for one variable graph?
So u got it?
I‚Äôm not giving tomo
I‚Äôll give it later
Next week
Wed
Idk
I‚Äôll see
Did u do elec assignment?
Any q
Then business?
Lol do u think she‚Äôll listen?
I‚Äôll try don‚Äôt expect anything
Did u atleast do the elec qs?
Dude which comp lab should we give?
It was lab 7
The structures and dynamic memory allocation walla
Sejal says ‚Äúon process‚Äù
Idk
üò≥üò≥
I sent see
The equation with ^ n and all gives my answer
I used the columns-adding-to-one walla like the MIT video
Dude they‚Äôre asking after so many years
So why 1,2 and 3 power?
They‚Äôve given that n is in terms of years
In the start of the q
Huh?
...
So pakka n=1,2,3?
Oi tell
Oh
Ya
The system changes state once every 2 yrs
Since lease is for 2 yrs
Crap
Thanks
Ya ull noe when ur wrong
It works best if one doesn‚Äôt do assignments last minute tho
For doing assignment...which only happened in the morning...I watched anime in the afternoonüòùüò∞üòµ
Anyways tomo during lunch I‚Äôll need help in doing elec...I dint understand some qs
Huh?
It kinda looks the same...it looks like ur desktop
Icons r nice
Nice status dude...grouse thoughts r nice
Is it already released? Or beta?
Just check whether the answer for the second electrical question which Shubham gave from his pendrive is rite or not?
Heat loss = That
Ya
Ya I‚Äôm calculating energy only
Basically one is i^2Rt and the other is IVT
5.3k something
No actual answer is 53xx.xxxx KW and 54xx.xxxx KW that‚Äôs a lot of error
Wait I‚Äôll send the ans after sometime
Having lunch now
Actually Samhita hv me the IVT method
Ya after lunch
Dude wht do u mean by secondary power factor and primary power factor
And while finding secondary current, should we use kW or kVA?
so?
Hell no
kVA is apparent power
kW is real power
Google it
No check
Crap now what?
I only did two questions...
Confirm what? Math assignment problem or kVA thingy?
Ok
Any progress on assignments?
Btw in the Chem
The coefficients should be divided rite?
Or multiplied?
Coefficient of I is 3
In the balanced eq
Then for what do we need to divide the coefficient?
For something we should do the division thing
So for diff rate eq and not the r= normal eq
And did u figure out what secondary power factor and all meant?
Send link for complex analysissss
I can‚Äôt find it on the net
I did...dint find it
That too I dint attend those classesüò∞üòìüòì
No i dint attend full complex analysis
Send link plsüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
Crap im not understanding shit...
Wait pdf is wrong?
üò≥üò≥
Ok can u send me only that question when u finish math?
Is that a yes or a no?
Thanks a lotüôèüèªüôèüèªüôèüèª
Can u plot complex functions in MATLAB?
Ok
And u said something was wrong with my math assignment...what was wrong?
It‚Äôs right only noe?? Forget theory shit I wrote but answers were rite only
The lease thing I corrected
I found A^1, A^2 and A^3
Instead of 2,4,6 powers
I don‚Äôt remember if I even wrote any theory shitüòÇ
Ohhh
That
I chucked it and I wrote the eq which the MIT guy said
He used this and got A^n*p nought
The first video we saw
The young dude not the old guy
K
Ya I used this
üëçüèª
Ayioooooo
X1=Ax0
U finished math?
Hey one more doubt
In civil
How do u do the last one? U get some very very big answer
U still dint finish math?
Everything else? Other subjects
Lol ya rite
And another doubt
The secondary power factor thingy
In elec last question
I got some solution but it doesn‚Äôt make sense...wait I‚Äôll send
Ya it‚Äôs not mine...g section someone
Hey send math once ur done
I finished one debate
Send mathhhh
I‚Äôll be doing business in the evening
Dude send math...please
The complex analysis q
Dude I don‚Äôt have time to sit and learn complex analysis...just send me pictures of that answer that‚Äôs fine
Sheesh tell that when u send the pdf
And how do u plot the level curves in MATLAB?
Ok
Thts it???
I‚Äôll ask you doubt tomo about the u(x,y) thingy
Thanksüëçüèªüëçüèªüéä
And ya I did it according to that pic which I sent
Centre of mass/gravity did yesterday....inertia walla got some very very very big answer so I dint do it
Shubham sent his so I‚Äôll see from that
I finished SVD I wrote some random stuff
Oh ya what happened to business? I forgot
Electrical is done btw
How much u have left?
Btw a bit of warning, pritams Chem debate first part is not right at all...it‚Äôs very vague
Thts alllüòµüòµüòµüòµüòµ
Wow ull finish of nicely
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Fml?
WhTs fml?
I can only think of cvs
*fbd
Huh?
Oh
Atbüëçüèª
Samhita said that her mom is doing business for her, and when she‚Äôs done she‚Äôll send it to me...I‚Äôll send it to u after I get it
Ya my phones on do not disturb since Friday
I asked my mom also...she has done stuff on communication and all before so she noes stuff...but she lectured me telling me I should do my assignmentsüòìüòìüòì
Bro I requested access
For the math one which u sent
Ya u definitely are jobless
And I wrote ‚Äúusing MATLAB‚Äù everywhere for the SVD example
Like using eig() and all
Holy shit that‚Äôs so frikkin trueüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hey for the electrical third question, what‚Äôs the energy wasted u got?
Well I did ask u that q
Because Samhitas dad wrote something else
No
Cuz joules law of heat states that the amount of energy lost while transmitting blah blah blah = I^2 r t
Then where do u use i^2 r t?
Ok
üëçüèª
How much left?
Woah talk about really bad luck
How much left anyway? A lot??
From whom????
Oh...ya I‚Äôll send
Ppt tho u should change stuff
Ok ok I‚Äôm writing it now chill I‚Äôll finish
Calculatation mistakes?
I dint take the symmetric axis thing
Dude what‚Äôs wrong just tell
It takes forever to go through that W
Q
Ok Gn then
Dude instead of sleeping u can draw that poster and keep...and scan it and put it in the assignment once ur son
*done
U before learning communication skills and u after learning communication skills
Lol I‚Äôm advertising deb club of our school indirectlyüòÇ
And don‚Äôt copy the poster
Ya
Dude the last q in math...how did u get ur graph like that????
üòíüòí tell noe
Can u send the picture of the graph?
Damn
Dude the civil first q...is mine rite?
I doubt any of my civil answers are rite
Check if u have fine
*time
Otherwise leave
And the moment of inertia q, my answer came in crores...screw it im sleeping
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Was the way I found the coefficient of friction right?
Ya I did the whole thing myself
Oh good
Even pics of slides r there
Nope comp left...I‚Äôll do tomo morn
I think 3
Ur not coming tomo?
Oh ok
üòÇ
...jobless person
Ur current situation is due to u overdoing math assignment and horrible luck
Nope
Technically from the slides
Yup
Asked my mom for tips and all
Did u sleep?
üò≥üò≥üò≥
Business won‚Äôt take long
I did it about 3 hrs...poster ppt everything
I had just gotten up when u texted me this
I slept at around 11
...
Is he alive??
Where r u?
Btw the guy getting electrocuted wasn‚Äôt in shawshank redemption, it was in the movie, the green mile
Huh?
Dude do we even have a debug session today? There‚Äôs nothing posted on the group
But tomo it‚Äôs sports day
Oh
üòÇ
Ya I told her
U actually went?üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Even g section dint get t-shirts...they don‚Äôt even noe about it
Dude that star delta thing, how do u connect the terminals on the machine thingy?
Like there r a lot of terminals...how do u connect them?
Ok not delta
Star
No in Tht stupid machine with all the knobs and all
And the wattmeter should be one-one or one-two?
Ya I forgot wht injective functions r, u mean one-one?
And where do we use upf wattmeter and the one-one walla wattmeter?
Like there r two kinds of wattmeter noe?
Upf has no one-one thing right?
One has power factor one doesn‚Äôt
So upf=one-one wattmeter
?
Where do we use the normal one?
Transformers we used the one-one walla for both tests
Wait I‚Äôm confused
What‚Äôs upf?
Upf is normal one noe,
*?
So upf and the one-one wattmeters r different
Wait a sec...we only measure power using the normal wattmeter in max power transfer
Everywhere else we use Tht other one
üòÇüòÇ
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dude whts the formula for slip in induction motor experiment?
Ok whts the rated speed of the motor?
Aey ur dp is normal
Ya who r u and what did u do to Satyajit?
Dude I asked Arvind for feedback and he said to meet him near the canteen during short break...do u also want to meet him?
Oi ask Aditya if he‚Äôs coming for that quiz...I asked Farhat Maam if we can register tomo but she said we should do it today it self
üòí
Yes for what?
Lazy person
üòíüòíüòí
Ik
Turns out as have EVS exam on that day
And she hasn‚Äôt replied when I said that we hv Evs exam on that day
She read the message but not replied
Dude and ask Chirag or someone about the innovation challenge
No one is answering on the CR group üòíüòíüòí
Aey ask Shubham or someone whether we should register for the quiz or what...that Farhat Maam isn‚Äôt replying only
The team sub leader Shubham
Wht pattern is this? Ur dp?
Wth...
Dude see thinmatrix‚Äôs channel
His tutorials for learning, and from the game he‚Äôs making, maybe we can get some ideas
Dude who to choose as third member?
Huh?
Oi compare the list with the leaderboard and see if anyone‚Äôs there
Who‚Äôs babya deep?
Chuck third member
Keep only 2
Ya but we r deciding based on marks...which is not a good thing
Ppl who noe stuff?
Nope
Lol only Aryan noes something
If u compare the leaderboard and the marks thing, only his name comes up huh?
So in the end, him only huh?
Idk anyone else...
So wht to do?
Then chuck...no ones coming to mind
He said yes
Now registration
Is it online or we hv to go to college?
30
Fee is 1000 per person?
Oh
Then how do we pay? 333 per person?
I‚Äôll get 1000 u guys pay me later
Should Aryan also come for registration ?
When u download and install unity, create an account or whatever(it‚Äôll ask u to when u run it) and I‚Äôll send a link for the project...there‚Äôs some ‚Äúcollaboration‚Äù thingy which lets multiple ppl (free version = max 3 ppl) to work on a project and upload the changes to cloud
Did u download already?
Ikr
Who‚Äôs prabhakar sir and is siraj rival some YouTube guy?
Dude can u send pics of all the complex analysis notes sir did? Including the questions, so like everything, from beginning of complex to conformal maps
Ya till conformal
Like conformal not included
Open interval
Ya ull mostly go off WhatsApp when exams r near, so I told u now only when ur free
Ok
Holy shit! A really normal dpüò±üò±üò±üò±

Ultra books hv dedicated graphics???
Ya it does
It‚Äôll be heavy most likely
Mine has 940M
Very hard to trust when they misspell powerful üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Now who‚Äôs studying
And whts with the dpüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dude send pics of all the complex analysis notes sir did Including the questions, so like everything, from beginning of complex to conformal maps
Hell frikkin no...I‚Äôm starting math today
I think my boot time is faster with LightDM
Nope
Yest I spent full day on the LightDM, splash screen, gdm stuff
üòíüòí
I asked the pic is not mine
U think I‚Äôll use windows???
Yup
Yup
Ikr wth
Dude in the pics u sent...where does it start from? Like which is pg 1?
So it‚Äôs backwards?
Wht intro to complex numbers?
There‚Äôs only CR eq and Tht Milne Thompson method in complex analysis noe? Or did he teach anything else?
Huh...I thought there was more
Dude...pics aren‚Äôt in orderüòìüòìüòì
This?
Why e^itheta*f‚Äô(z) in the first place?
No clue
Thnx
Thnx
One more doubt...how do u integrate (1+e^-x)/x?
This was a q given by sir in class
Ya I got Tht...just need k
How do u get k?
They‚Äôve given length of the curve and x not y and x
Btw check ur eq...from where x^2 came in the integration? It‚Äôs CG not MI
Oh then fine
Someone‚Äôs forgetting about the amount of work we hv after exams...codechef it seems
Ya ik
Take it as reference...we‚Äôll hv to program in whtever language we can
No ctrl c and ctrl v
Like for concept and Lagos
*algos
Depends on wht engine we‚Äôll end up using
Yup
Idk...how do u run other language code from another languages compiler?
The dude uses lua or something in the book
Ya like that
No he talks about lua scripting also...I saw in the index
I‚Äôm wondering how u run python code from the game engine, which uses c# or c++
Unreal uses c++
But I think there‚Äôs hardware requirements for unreal
Not sure
Ikr...
Someone should kill the judge
üòíüòíüòíüòí
What???
Instead of a new laptop buy this for ur desktop
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Chuck ur i5 and buy that then
It also costs 70k?
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ya best not
U r doing the innovation challenge stuff rite?
-_- we don‚Äôt hv soo much time uk
College will start in 10 days or so
Go read Tht book I sent
-_-
It‚Äôs not working?
Oh
Trees maybe idk
Try brute force only on array A
Then multiply the answer u get with K
Not exactly
Brute force in the sense try getting all sub arrays and then adding them
Sub arrays can hv num of elements >= 1
U did on array B or A?
Try on A
Then multiply answer with K
Like for array A={1,-2,1}, sub array with max sum is {1} multiply that with K u get 2
True
There should be an efficient way to find sub arrays instead of the brute force
//www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-subarray-with-given-sum-in-array-of-integers/
These ppl used maps
Time complexity is O(n)
Similar q btw not same
I dint understand the logic tho
It is same
Thts what I was saying
U do this and multiply the answer with K
And tada!
Do it on A
Why?
If u treat A as a circular array and then find the max itll work
üòíüòíüòíüòí
U used this and circular array idea and still got TLE?
This is O(n)
Huh?
Array B is essentially same as array A
Instead of using B, treat array A as circular and do it
Chuck B it‚Äôs not needed at all
This will be confusing to do tho
Using Tht algo not brute force
Why 10^10 time?
raw_input() doesn‚Äôt exist in python 3
Did it finally?
AC?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Read group messages
U awake???
Ya?
I already did
Wht did u do??
Unity is similar btw
Both r game engines
U can import Fbx files into blender
I hv 3ds max...tomo I‚Äôll export the ones into .blend...rite now my windows is updating
I started updating at 5...it‚Äôs still going onüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
It‚Äôs working?
Blender doesn‚Äôt hv animation?
Oh
Windows is shit slowüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
üòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòíüòí
What repo?
Unreal doesn‚Äôt hv any built in thingy?
Like how unity had, that collab thing
Oh
AI and BCI
they gv Tht feedback form rite? I filled it that time only
How the hell do I do that?
And sync it with what?
This is windows not Linux
Software?
Did any rigging?
Use rigify which comes with blender...they hv basic rig shapes for quadrupeds which will make things 100 times easier
Rigging not working...
Rigged it, while testing shit is happening
I rotate the tail and instead of the tail end removing the upper body moves for some reason
I did something is wrong
Sighhh ya
Won‚Äôt be able to finish it by today...thts for sure
No I‚Äôll do wolf
If u get the tiger rite after testing it in pose mode do the others
//m.youtube.com/watch?v=cGvalWG8HBU
Try following this method while rigging, it‚Äôll make animating them waaaaay easier
It‚Äôs called an inverse kinematics rig
Oh and somehow I managed to lose the teeth and tongueüòìüòìüòìüòìüòì
Used rigify yest...had more problems actually...this full thing was done manually
I found a video on how to fix it...but it‚Äôs complicated
The other wolf should be easier
The IK thing is cool
The second wolf one is perfect
Hv to fix the tail thts all
This wolf model is the same as the second one...the hair stuff is a separate object itself...I guess thts why this one is not working so well but the second simpler wolf is perfect
Simple wolf riggedüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
//www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/introduction-to-rigging
this guy fixes a similar problem to yours i think...in the vid the skirt(pant whatever) doesnt move so he does some stuff
im going to follow this when i fix the wolf 1
Select the tiger model, and under the modifiers tab there will be something called armature...in that select the check box called preserve volume
Finished deer 2üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
I hope what we did is riteüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
It doesn‚Äôt fix it...it only somewhat fixes it and prevents some problems
Use rigifys basic quadruped metarig
I‚Äôm using that only
Whts this?
Btw ur using blender rite?
*parented not patented
The wolf animal rig had stuff for jaws and eyeballs and all so I dint use it
Broke? How?
Thts nice but the bones r moving out of the model itself
This is envolope?
Where?
Goat????
Fixed it...used the .obj model instead of the .fbx
Done with deer
No I never did
I‚Äôm following wht this dude does
He uses human meta rig but I use quadruped
He does
Some old version which only has human meta rig but the steps stay the same
2.6 blender I think
I don‚Äôt think it will
U sync I‚Äôll put in in the drive...I dint download Tht GitHub thingy and the first wolf rigging is annoying me
Aryan should do some of the animations
Noooo
The first wolf looks like a wolf, the second one kinda looks like a dog
Ya
Ya more or less
üëçüèª
U rig the best and I‚Äôll finish the wolf
*bear
Quad
Keep it simple
Wait wht?
It might be difficult rigging this
It‚Äôs in some weird pose
U finished bear???
Use weight paint mode to fix stuff
Thts how I‚Äôm fixing the wolf thingy
Send vid ?
Send when u get up then
Finished rigging the first wolf model, I put it in the drive
Wht r u gonna do today?
The rigging?
Use the links I sent
This for rigging
This for IK
üëçüèª
Only part 1 btw...I dint see part 2 and 3
The unreal project stuff is on github?
Not low poly trees?
Wait
I‚Äôll do the rigging, I‚Äôm used to it now so I‚Äôll be able to finish it faster
U start with the unreal part
Like learn how to use unreal
Ok so bear and tiger left?
U start with this and AI...we don‚Äôt hv much time left
Terrain let Aryan do
We can put some add ins later
Ya üëçüèª
I‚Äôll install github too
*extra stuff whatever
Ok so I‚Äôll finish rigging, u start with unreal and AI
And Aryan continues with terrain
I‚Äôll join u with unreal and AI stuff after I finish rigging
This is rite rite?
Crap I hv to figure out how to use github nowüòìüòìüòì

Dude...why the hell is the repo huge??
Can I upload to the repo? Or do u need to give me permissions and all?
Add me then
Like soon pls
Today atleast
I can edit the files I download tho rite?
Download/clone what do u call it
Oh ok
Oh the terminologies
Ok üëçüèª
But it‚Äôs faded so I need permission rite?
Thts how u use this thing?
üòÖ
üëçüèª
Ya it doesn‚Äôt
Ok I hopefully figured this thing out
Yup it did
Ikr
It still is life in blender
üëçüèªüëçüèª
Wait
Chuck it it‚Äôs working
How big can the repo be? It‚Äôs already 700mb
So technically one can use it as a drive rite?
Ohhhh
So why don‚Äôt ppl do?
Oh
Oh
Ok ya thts over kill
Finished just now
Bear gv me some trouble
Ya this bear
It‚Äôs called weight painting
Ya this is waaay better
The blade looks like paneer
This is nice

I did
When u texted only
Why enterprise? Community won‚Äôt work??
Oküëçüèª
Sheesh I don‚Äôt like how unreal looks...unity is a lot more cleaner
Still...it‚Äôs really not nice
Tht makes things easier
But we should also come up with something unique
Innovation
Ya
Don‚Äôt push 30 gig of useless stuff into the repo!!!
I don‚Äôt want to download all that!
Wht all did u get? 30 gig is a lot of stuff
Wth...
Is it up in repo?
Can u set it as optional or something?
Or r u using it in the project?
Home
Leaving day after
U made it?
Btw our game is first person
Cuz we need to find a model and make more animations
We got our mythical animals
Now if we can extract only the models and make them low poly, change the texture and put it back then all‚Äôs good
Wth...
No Modern weapons!
It‚Äôll break any sort of immersion Tht may be there in the game
Send pic
It will
I‚Äôll see wht I can do
First person is decided tho rite?
I hv a vague idea on how to do it in unity, so I hv to make it in unreal
Very vague mind u
First person will be easier...we‚Äôll only need to animate the hands not the whole body
Don‚Äôt torture u poor laptop
Seriously
I won‚Äôt be surprised if it explodes
Dude low poly trees also
Not like as the style, but keep the polygon count less
It‚Äôll be faster then
On ur laptop or desktop?
Check laptop
Sejal‚Äôs?
Put it on the debug communication group

Lwjgl is java
Light Weight Java Game Library
Minecraft is written using lwjgl
For what we‚Äôre doing normal java is fine...it renders a bit slowly on Linux(for a shit number of reason, either kernel issue or some driver thing I couldn‚Äôt find out exactly) but it runs perfectly in windows
If I hv time I‚Äôll do the lwjgl stuff
Most probably u and Aryan will be doing the AI stuff
Did u learn anything about A*?
Like what it needs(inputs) and wht it gives out(outputs)?
I‚Äôll need to noe this actually
A* algo in context of AI and stuff for the project
üòíüòíüòí
According to CR group and past history 11-1 = exhibition and then classes will resume
Nope if u attend I will literally kill u
No both classes
Hey when we were learning C u said something like windows cares or doesn‚Äôt care about something...I think the context was pointers...u found out Tht ur code worked in Linux but not windows cuz of some reason...wht was it?
Some program...not sure which
There‚Äôs a similar problem in the program...error doesn‚Äôt occur in java code, but whatever OpenGL stuff it calls
Works on Ubuntu but not in windows
Or specifically works on intel but not Nvidia

Like a hash map where the key is the cell number and the values r the list of entities in Tht cell
No no
As in cell number
It‚Äôs an int
Wht is Cell class Tht u use?
Ur class? Not inbuilt?
Wth is i,j,f,g and h?
We‚Äôll discuss in the class...Tht time explain be the basics of the classes
Update repo btw
Which includes reorganisation of the AI package
Added the map in EntitesMap class
And and FPS counter

AND ILL GET FUCKING LIGHTING TO WORK BY THEN
Maybe
Hopefully
The fest is for all years noe?
And PG ppl
?
Bunking EC to program shaders
Or atleast make the program use the most basic shader
Hopefully I‚Äôll finish this
U can also bunk
BUT finish the AI thing if ur bunking
Then do whatever u want
Plus ull miss Tht annoying test sir said he‚Äôll give
Priorities
Hopefully I‚Äôll get proxy somehow
Ya rite nice bunking üòí
Crap ya

Dude if I hv to ellipses which r defined by there eq, how do I check if they are intersecting?
Like comp wise
Mathematically if u can solve them then they r intersecting but if u hv to rite a prog to check if they‚Äôre intersecting then what?
I was thinking of using ellipse eqs...it‚Äôll be easier in detecting and i think also when the object rotates
Is there an eq for a rectangle?
Basically my issue is that if the object rotates by like 60 degrees, everything gets screwed up
Unless the object is symmetrical like a circle
Eg
Any amount of rotation actually
It‚Äôs not a major issue but still
Oh whenever u hv some small free time, think of some nice minimal kind of background pic
Suitable ones
Like a minimal dungeon
Idk chuck minimal then
It should not look cheapüëçüèª
Ok two separate functions tho
Huh?
Oh
Send me how to create a Pair object with two ints
Those <> thingies?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Sounds like a hashMap kind of thingy
Like key - value pair
Make a list of Tht and u hv a pseudo hashMap thingy
Ohhhh
What did u do??!
It is
And I had to change the visibility of ur Pair class constructor to public
It was default
I‚Äôm pulling
I‚Äôm seeing wait
‚ÄúThe configured merge tool was not found‚ÄùüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I somehow did
Clicked pull twice and it worked
Dude why is everything static?
It won‚Äôt screw stuff up noe?
Cuz each enemy should be able to calculate their paths to their destination without interfering with each other
Ok let‚Äôs see if it works
I have to make stuff static now
U don‚Äôt have a Boolean array anymore
The function which I made?
I pushed
Pushing again
After making stuff static
Pushed
Is there a toString function for stack?
So I can see the coordinates?
Or I‚Äôll use normal for loop to see what‚Äôs in the stack
What‚Äôs in the stack anyway? Pairs noe?
Nm
What do u mean when ‚Äúsource of the destination is blocked‚Äù?
Wait
I had asked u to offset the destination a bit
So the enemy won‚Äôt go crashing into the player
How do I calculate the offset then?
I‚Äôm also getting ‚Äúdestination is invalid thingies
When this happens, the stack isn‚Äôt updated noe?
Destination is valid only
I‚Äôll check the validation code again
Ok in the mean time I‚Äôll check whether what‚Äôs printed is rite or what
It calculates the path correctly
But if my enemy starting location is 700 ur code gives arrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
Fixed this
Ok I‚Äôll check
Still outOfBounds
The invalid dest thing? Ya it was I had flipped the checking conditions by mistake
Wait I did +2 since I subtracted one in the constructor
Now I‚Äôm getting null pointer somewhere so I‚Äôll check that wait
Dude
Ur code is trying to check whether a nonexisting cell is unblocked or notüòÇüòÇüòÇ
No check line 124 of Asearch.java
The loop conditions if it exists
Then what should I return if cell doesn‚Äôt exist?
False?
Basically validate then check
Dude check ur function call
I think u flipped x and y
Cuz validateCell works perfectly now, I checked it also using players coordinates
U want me to push the stuff which makes an error?
Ok I pushed it
So when u run, it‚Äôll give error
Push ur code
Line 294
Check ur code again for any other switches u made by mistake
Ya the i, j values r causing the problems
Flip them and see what happens
The map doesn‚Äôt contain a key like that so error
Oh like that
Wait I‚Äôll try
It works
But wait a sec...if ur codes fine then the map should not been initialised rite wait I‚Äôll check
As in it doesn‚Äôt crash
Wait
Dude how do I stop those things from printing?
Like in ur code
Where is it?
No i need to print something else
So I don‚Äôt want this in the way
Ya I found it
Dude check that part again in ur code...the error should not come
Basically x=[0,35]...it‚Äôs the number of rows in the thing...when u increment x, row coordinate should change or column coordinate?
Cuz in tht invalid destination, u had used x in such a way that incrementing it would change the current column
Ya and in this null pointer exception it changes row
So somewhere it‚Äôs flipped
Ya
Damn this is confusing
How did u take ur x and y as?
Make sure ur consistent everywhere and cross check it
Ya
Then this?
Changing column is like going left and right
Then the null pointer thingy way is rite
Then why do I get destination invalid?
Nope
Wait
validateCell is fine
So r ur cords
But still I‚Äôm getting destination invalid
So ur sending me switched cords
Then I‚Äôll get null pointer
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Don‚Äôt be lazy go check ur code
Then it won‚Äôt work properly it self
Ur sending me y, x sometimes and x, y sometimes
Ya and don‚Äôt end up switching it in the constructor also
Even I have to use Pair...it‚Äôs useful in someplaces
Use Pair and push it...I‚Äôm sleeping now

Hope everything goes well
U said u would do everything using Pair
So waiting for that
Anyways I doubt I‚Äôll do anything today
Phy portions r a lot compared to other sub
Oh good
Hey can u send the MI of circular disk derivations?
Aeyyy
Too lazy to think
Ya I‚Äôm free
Programming
Wait when is it?
^^
If it‚Äôs before assignments then I‚Äôll be doing the assignment and the innovation challenge
Then no clue
Haven‚Äôt planned anything
So god noes
Why?
Who?
Lol my mom won‚Äôt let
Goa and all complete no
Ik, but even then she won‚Äôt let
It‚Äôs a mom thing so idk...she told me in the beginning of college only
Nope that won‚Äôt happen
Sorry bro?
No like no going on trips and all...she dint let my sis only go, and my sis finished 4 yrs of college
I‚Äôll ask
Who four and when?
And how long
Btw how the hell r u going to go to goa?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I‚Äôll ask
K
That I can‚Äôt promise
Let‚Äôs see what happens
Wait we hv holidays?
Akaira is for how long?
I
*ok
Dude AI
Finish the Pair thingy
Give it by tomo
The code
Seriously
I also need time to do stuff
I got screwed üëçüèª
She‚Äôs like no going out of station anywhere
I did
She was like u dint want to stay in hostel and now u want to go out of station?
Lol I‚Äôll get kicked out of the house
Hostel
Not hotel
Ya not me...I want nice food and bed and my room
Sorry bro
I definitely don‚Äôt want to get screwed again
AtbüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Duh
Then don‚Äôt
She‚Äôll probably let u do it in like 3/4 ur
*yr
Either way, by tomo u hv to finish the AI stuff...and make sure u don‚Äôt switch any arguments in the function call or while making a Pair object...like seriously double check everything
I can‚Äôt comeü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
It‚Äôs the only answer I can give

^^^???
U do noe Tht we hv to finish it by Thursday rite?
And I still hv to link up ur code with mine rite?
And u do noe we hv assignments also rite?
Can I hv ur assignments?
For ref
I wont make the same mistake againüëçüèª
üòÖ
So give it by tomo
The AI stuff
No try and all give it by tomo
Oooh btw next Monday which movie?
Assignment submission day
No laptop
Dude...why...ur laptopüò™üò™
I would like my laptop to live
Thts assignment?
Idk but u can put a 3D plot
Dude we changed the game theme
Instead of dungeon crawler it‚Äôs some time pass game which u find in phonesüòÇüòÇüòÇ
It still fits with what we‚Äôve done till now
And finish the AI
got timings for the innovation challenge...looks like we have to bunk lab on thursday
Finished it ?
U do know that 8th is the day we hv to present noe?
And thts like day after tomorrow you know?
Nope
No Idk wtf r u talking about?

Dude ur ASearch line 294 is causing a lot of problems
U do ur classes editing
It‚Äôs coming outOfBounds at 37 not 700üòíüòíüòí
And ur idea of using try catch to catch the null pointer doesn‚Äôt work
Cuz it returns false the areas where the invalid destination thingy was happening now gives source or destination is blocked
What hmmmmm
We hv to fix it!
The final day is day after!
I‚Äôm pushing stuff
I hope ur trying to fix itüòëüòëüòë
Pushed
What?
So ur not fixing it üòëüòëüòë
Idiot
Ok good u r trying to fix it
Asshole
Shut up and go do
üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Now go fix it
No thank u and ignore them
of rows is 35
Figure it out
Seriously
Yup
Do the same thing like the vid
U get outOfBounds
U figured it out?
Try figuring out why it‚Äôs 37 instead of 35
How r u initializing ur array/list?
Makes sense if the name is cells rather than cell btw...a cell can‚Äôt hv more cells in it
Oh no
*nm
Cell is a class
So this basically is the whole game window rite? With 35 rows and 63 columns
Now what r the iterating variables value?
*values
Is Tht necessary? I mean can‚Äôt u just make i go till rows and j go till cols?
The issue is happening here I think
Or is it like the iterating variables aren‚Äôt in for loops? U increment/decrement them based on the path in current direction ur trying to find out?
The problems here
Damn u want to bunk electronics to figure this out?
Don‚Äôt tell anyone else
We can ask Shubham to write it down
Sejal also will write it
We‚Äôll tell him next time
If he asks
Tht we had to prepare for the innovation challenge so we couldn‚Äôt come for his class
If he asks, I‚Äôll talk to him
Otherwise chuck it
I need attendance
Eh...taking it literally Tht is one false statement
I meant it literally
Like if some one asks u why pencils hv erasers then saying cuz ppl r not perfect is not the right and

He only has
Btw I think I fixed it
No more null pointers
No more ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
No more destination is invalid
Path calculation seems fine
Although movement calculation (my thingy not urs) is wrong now...for some reason the enemy circles the player in a very big circleüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ

I got it properly only
Btw did EC sir do all Tht alpha and beta stuff for transitors?
Is the last q in EC use Tht stuff?

I need hint atleast
Wht do u think I‚Äôm doing?
4.2 done
Btw if u noticed my EC thing I sent, I finished clamper and zenerüòõüòõüòõ
Either way, u should rite the correct specifications
Like the data sheet stuff
Ya this is assignment so complete theory
Shit ya
I always screw up Vp-p
Even in lab
I dint get it
The last two sub qs
Then what?
Like what explanation would u rite?
From where Ull get this?
The thingy is a common collector amplifier
I used wolfram for this

I dint see it yet
U did bivariate?

Dude send me the report pattern thing for sociology
Search and see noe?
We can use the IISC reports in discussion
In introduction normal stuff, like what is pollution and intro to Bellandur Lake
Afaik?
Then flow won‚Äôt be there noe? Like intro should be intro and discussion should hv details
Hopefully
We both will do discussion
Send the report links noe?
It‚Äôs somewhere in the first page of the search results only noe?
Ya
So we‚Äôll do how many fire incidents?
Two major ones is fine...not much is available for the smaller incidents
And then we hv to read the reports to figure out wht all stuff to put in
And some random ‚Äúlegit‚Äù testimonials talking about how residents life is affected and all
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Note quotes
Then done
So two incidents and impact with testimonials
Wth
Two change?
2/3 pages can be done with this much I think
Atleast 3
Ok all testimonials will be anonymous
And do some rearranging of words so Tht no plagiarism
Make it look like we actually went there and talked to ppl üòõüòõüòõ
So who does what?
üòíüòíüòíüòí
U do 2018 incident and testimonials
I‚Äôll do some other major incident and impact
Since we both 3 so one person 1.5
Yup
Like assignment
Ya seriously...it‚Äôs common sense
Dude wth is Tht constant coefficient thingy??
One of the methods to solve second order ODE
Did he do anything like that?
Tht formula? Where we ended up proving inverse of differentiation is integration
Damn send notes noe then?
I don‚Äôt hv it
Crap ya
...
He taught it for one day only?
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ

What I did also is rite only noe?
It‚Äôs WHAT
Read the q properly, there‚Äôs no question mark üòÇüòÇüòÇ
My method
‚ÄúWhat is the name of the fourth son.‚Äù No question mark here
Then goodüëçüèª
I posted it on iroids see
Huh? Not roots of the eq?
Wait oops
When u factorise u get rootsüòÖ
Yc?
Ya even in Tht MIT courseware stuff
Uk what change of plan
U write about the incidents and testimonials, I‚Äôll write about detailed cause...I found shit lot of information on iisc
Too much Chem thoüòì
We‚Äôll change only if u haven‚Äôt started yet
Ok then
I found too much info
This would‚Äôve been helpful during the presentationsüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Which question? The question I had a doubt in dint hv a 5 anywhere
How exactly did u get this?
It‚Äôs cos x ik but I thought u had to rite cos x as e^ix-i sin x
I‚Äôm not sure...cuz I asked Sumanth sir also this and even he said take it as real part of e^ix...I dint understand it too much so i did my way
Btw how do u solve those boundary value problems?
U can do the second thing he said, using the general formula and integrating and all, tho I think it‚Äôll be complicated
^^?
Like substitute the given values noe?
And substitute in y or yc or yp?
Which one I‚Äôm asking
Ok
If they give y‚Äô(x) then we hv to differentiate the answer and then substitute???
If they give y‚Äô=0?
Wht let it be?
Like in the 6th one
Send pic of the substitution parts thtll be enough
Lol it‚Äôs sinpleüòÇüòÇüòÇ

Seriously wht sort of autocorrecting is that?
Yup
Dude the way u wrote it, it so sounds like we dint go there and talk to ppl
And not much info about the fire incidents
MATLAB works on antergos?
Like the crack
Arch?
Ok
Switching to arch
Chucking Ubuntu
No triple booting again, that was a nightmare
It felt heavy
Too many unnecessary things were there
Nope, tried starting dhcpcd since Ethernet wasn‚Äôt working then Tht happened
I hv to hard boot it once Tht happens
Ya I‚Äôll try in the evening
It worked before but after I deleted the Ubuntu partition this started happening
Installing antergos is easier?
Like gui and all is there?
Good I think I‚Äôll try Tht mostly
üò´ I‚Äôll need it
I already deleted my Ubuntu partition
Now I can‚Äôt get grub riteü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
See i arch-chroot first
Then mount EFI partition to /boot
Then download and install grub and a bunch of other stuff(pacman)
Then install grub using grub-install ‚Äîtarget=blah blah blah
Then generate the grub cfg file
The thing is the first time I did it it dint detect windows
/boot ends up having an EFI folder with folders such as windows and arch and all
Oh and now my vmzlinux files r missing too from /boot
So any idea what I should do?
Arch
Whts Tht?
Oh wow
U could‚Äôve said it when I tripled booted the damn thing
I triple booted arch windows and Ubuntu noe?
Kernel panic
Architect is not working
Cannot find disk by label or some random thing
Tried fixes dint work
Tried renaming but couldn‚Äôt rename in windows...plus the name was rite only
Ok I give up I‚Äôll put antergos
Solved the grub issue, but now even Ethernet is not working and I can‚Äôt shutdown onlyü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
Any other arch/antergos like thingy which can be used for college stuff?( like matlab and all)
Updates and all is there? Or is it like some random rare thingy and not popular enough
I asked arch based
^?
üëçüèª
Is it light weight?
Or heavy as Ubuntu?
Antergos vs manjaro based on light weight mess?
üëçüèª
I HATE MANJARO
STUPID GRUB NOT SHOWING UP

Dude u hv the MATLAB install file?
For Linux
Ya I really need it
I don‚Äôt have matlab for Windows
And assignments r coming up
I completely forgot
I‚Äôll take both
I hv to boot into grub in a very weird way...manually select it in bios
I mean why?
Just why???
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Turns out it‚Äôs cuz HP hardcodes the system to boot from windows already or something
I had to press F9 while it booted to go there
And it‚Äôs messy
I hate how

I fuckin want to kill Realtek
No Ubuntu is fine
Culprit is here
PCIe bus error cause Realtek
WiFi problems cause Realtek

This shit in the afternoon
And arch in the morning
I installed arch like 5/6 times yest
And Manjaro 4/5 times
And I only had one usb stick
So I had to boot into windows to create a gparted live disk, remove all shit, boot back into windows and then create a manjaro/arch live disk and install
Surprisingly ya
I had to manually edit stuff tooüòÇüòÇüòÇ
And the fix for the manjaro issue is to trick windows into booting manjaros EFI file
Intelligent device üòÇüòÇüòÇ
So hv to copy pasting and editing and all in the EFI partition
Yup
Backing up windows EFI first tho
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Turns out if u do this u can‚Äôt boot into windows...cuz when u choose windows it‚Äôll link back to the same EFI and load grub again...so hv to edit stuff
Aey I hv to download that thing and create a bootable drive then do stuff...safer just back it up and if issue comes, renaming will fix it
What I don‚Äôt get it arch was fine with all this...why is manjaro acting so weird??
üòìüòìüòì
So how‚Äôs it perfect?
Then whts uv catastrophe?
Isn‚Äôt it when lambda is 0 infinite energy?
Exactly
So how is Planck perfect?
WiFi fix is so simple in manjaroüò±üò±üò±üò±
Nope even easier
Create a conf file
Add some options
Done
I got shocked
Like really
Btw which app?
Ganna?
Ohhhh
Lol thts the main thingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
From which file u run matlab?
I installed it in /opt/matlab but which file to run?
Damn...it‚Äôs giving license error

Dude in the LED blinker circuit, how do u link the frequency of blinking with the resistances and all?
Is it same as source frequency?
Nm I somewhat got that q
Using astable multivibrator only
How do u plot the stupid q point in multisim?
Or how do u find it in multisim??
Ya I did that
But I got tons of variables
Which one to choose?
Dif places on the net say dif things...and DC operating point does not plot the load line
*DC operation point analysis
Dint start yet
Ya I‚Äôm doing EC and finishing
I don‚Äôt hv

Pdf atleast
The conversion to second order ODE is that simple?
Did everything except debate and that justify whether neutron can be diffracted
U just differentiated the eqs and substituted it noe?
No other fancy method?
Ya thts wht it‚Äôs simple
Substituting it is hard?
Ya
üò≥üò≥üò≥
So u wrote all that???
Or this is with all those steps cut?
Oh ok
Thank god
The q is a homogenous one seriously?
Why is there h/a in the H(t) solution?
And how come the roots for both r same?
The compute population answer is in terms of constants?
Is it right?
U said the answer should come in terms of constants
But ur answer is in terms of constants
And I dunno if this is right or what
Cuz why r the constants same in both the eqs?
Shouldn‚Äôt it be like k1,k2,k3 and k4?
I tried, while getting the homogenous eq for the H part I ended up getting an A in the eq...I couldn‚Äôt eliminate it
the first order eqs?
3rd order?!
I meant I got an A after substituting the first order eq in the second order one
Is my ans right tho?
Ya i got stuck here
Got A‚Äôs in H eq
Dude what‚Äôs the error function for the last q last part in math?
Huh? But then how do u justify which is better?
What did u do?
Ok I used the function to generate the values of y using x values and subtracted them from the given y values and summed them up
And I called this error
Quad fit gv 0 error
Whereas exp fit gv some -3. Something
How to put multiple labelsüò´üò´üò´üò´
Stupid thing is overwriting
Dude what‚Äôs the ans for b2.1 the justify whether the neutron beam can be diffracted by a Crystal thing?
How is diffraction related to charge?
And mass is irrelevant, size matters
Size of the particle should be comparable with the obstacle
Wait
Wavelength should be comparable
So?
Ya thts a q

How do u solve the boundary value problem? Like when they give y(something)=something

Ohhh ok I switched it around
Umm the values r constants not functions
Ayiooo ok ok they r variables which can mean anything üëçüèª

Variation of parameters on a fourth order differential equation?
Possible?
I‚Äôm guessing it is, but u can‚Äôt use that formula which sir gave...ull have to derive a different one cuz U‚Äôll get a 4x4 matrix rite?

Dude u noe how to use raspberry pi with sensors?
Beginner tips?
There r other os‚Äôs for raspberry
Dad is using it for his work thing and he‚Äôs using Ubuntu mate arm/arch something for raspberry pi
Like is it possible to get the output directly from the gpio pin? Is there code for that?
Instead of going to the sensor company website and getting code from there
But it is possible to access the gpio pins via code
In raspbian at least
Arch in the sense not arch Linux, the name had arch and I hv no clue what it means
Thanks manüëçüèª
i386 is 32 bit I‚Äôm sure of that
Dude any other light Linux os uk?
Which can run on a core 2 duo
Basically an ancient laptop
Without lag
The ancient laptop in question runs Mac something
Lubuntu?
üëçüèª
I got temp sensor working with mate
Dint hv any problems
Apart from getting confused with the sensors themselves
üëçüèª
I can‚Äôt come moms not letting
Sorry bro
Btw ```su``` doesn‚Äôt mean super user it means switch user
Happy bday dude!
Hv fun today!
It is good
Although more organising could have been done...like in the basics thing why is there plotting? That‚Äôs not exactly basic
And 1.1 should‚Äôve been the loops and 1.2 the graphs
Like step by step
True but this is a tutorial rite? So ppl watching it hv no clue what MATLAB is
So slowly introduce stuff
Ur intro could‚Äôve used some work
But other than that everything is pretty good actually
Seriously tho...I‚Äôm was wondering why u jumped first to graphs then started teaching loops üòÇüòÇüòÇ
I didn‚Äôt  go that far
Weird name
Huh? Won‚Äôt that hang stuff? Like if all threads r used up then nothing is left
Syntax
U covered functions?
How to symbolic expressions
Explanation of inline functions
Conversion between the two
What other features r there?
Btw I dint ignore u or something since I dint come today
I would‚Äôve come if I could
üëçüèªüëçüèª
I‚Äôll look into it
Users on dif network
How does it work anyway?
I hv no clue
what‚Äôs node js?
Compiler?
Then aren‚Äôt u running two servers ?
Wait no
So node js acts like a intermediary between the app and the db
Damn that‚Äôs interesting alright
Although I hate react VR
For some reason node js reminds me of this
Hellllllll
Probably cuz that YouTube guy in VIT recommended learning node js and advised us to us react vr
Sounds like some car engineüòÇüòÇüòÇ
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Btw why did u hv difficulty with the pi? Like with the sensors and stuff
How?
U get horrible signal with that
Ya that‚Äôs the max
Uk anything abt yocto?
*yocto project
Custom Linux kernel and stuff for embedded systems
I want ur laptop for that
Ramüò≠üò≠üò≠
It builds the kernel and other stuff depending on ur preference
Building takings waaaaay too much ram and cpu
Plus I hv to run it on a vm
The build
I‚Äôm not too sure abt that tho
We should create a chat system
Let each chat be an object of sorts...it‚Äôll have an Id and the convos
But the convos need to be stored in a phone database
They did mention this before
Btw ill be going thru android tutorials today so I‚Äôll be able to help in sometime
Ya
I think I remember them taking abt sql
Sql is there in android?
What I‚Äôll do? I learnt python for like 2 years already
I also wrote an android ish app in python for my project, but couldn‚Äôt build it for androidüòÖ
Stupid thing failed all the time
This is same as the previous one u sent
But ya it‚Äôs goodüëçüèª
Menu reminds me of google maps
I want to do something fancy tho...I‚Äôll do it after I learn
The thing with this is that I think loading the previous chats will be little harder...it should be seamless so we should implement chunking  of sorts? Like efficient chunking
It played on my phoneüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Something unique
And minimalüëçüèª
Dunno if the term is called chunking tho...chunking is there for efficient loading of the game world in games but god noes if it‚Äôs the same for apps
Ya
And also we should be able to handle situations like 1000000000 users also
Hmm...on the phone and is it possible on the server? Like if the user deletes the app by mistake all his chats r gone
Or implement some back up feature?
Yasssssss
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Back up to google drive
Is it possible?
Ok ya better storing messages on server will take up a lot of space on the server
We‚Äôll do this at the last
Like WhatsApp chat backup
Generate random number and check if that number is already an id of a chat and if it is, generate again?
What‚Äôs the format of the id?
Ya let‚Äôs finish the basic things first
But it has to be unique write?
*right
Ppls reg num?
Hmm how abt combing the ppls reg number?
It‚Äôll be easier and always unique
Ok something that tells whether it‚Äôs a chat between two students, a student and a faculty or whether it‚Äôs a chat between two faculty members...then combine the last three numbers of the two ppls registration number
üëçüèª
Like if it‚Äôs between u and me, then <something>159178
Or <something>159-178
<something> is something that tells who r the ppl chatting, whether student or factuality
*faculty
So a letter maybe
And the id for both ppl should be same?
Then one phone should generate the id and send it to the other phone
*chat_ids
Each chat is an object
It‚Äôll be easier to handle
Oh ya correct
Then combine the chats and id as an object so manipulation will be easy
The phone which creates the chat should create the id and send it across to the other phone
N number of unique palindromes...üò≥
üëçüèª
Any good tutorials uk?
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOIüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
That is nice...but canteen ppl will use that?
Why don‚Äôt u just get the value and then manipulate it to create the chat_id?
Although ya makes sense somewhat
Another thing is that u have to request the server for the other persons ref number to form the id
Variables in python aren‚Äôt ‚Äúcontainers‚Äù that store values, they point to the values in memory
C IS THE STUPIDEST LANGUAGE IN EXISTENCE
CREATORS OF C ARE LAZY AS HELL
üò≥
How did they get jobs üò≥üò≥üò≥
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
The workshop was abt basics?
Ohhhh
Damn dude niceüëçüèª
Umm...won‚Äôt that be headache?
How r u loading the messages? Like if a convo has like 10000000 messages do u load all of them on the screen?
Wow
Ya best don‚Äôt
Ya otherwise RAM will die
Data are on dif servers?
Wait make senses...u dint pay for stuff
I doubt they‚Äôll Give a dedicated server for free
Mongo ppl
Like centralising instead of it being distributed
Server DB is what then?
I‚Äôm pretty sure u need money for that
‚ÄúOur server‚Äù in the sense?
Oh like that
I thought u did something similar to cloud stuff or whatever...like the DB is somewhere else not in ur house
Getting a lease line for a never changing public ip also required money
üëçüèª
OhüòÇ
He‚Äôll give u a lease line for free?
Oh
Ya duh
That can‚Äôt be free
Btw do u noe whether u can identify a sensor that is connected to a pi via code?
Good no cheating
How?
This pi thing is taking sometimeüòì
Ya point
Ya exactly
Uart?
I don‚Äôt I ssh
Ssh
I use multiple pis so I need to ssh
Sensors?
Don‚Äôt have so many ports and I don‚Äôt want my table to be messy
Hey how do I use these pins?
Umm...what‚Äôs that?
My uncle needs some temperature and power consumption monitoring in the server room of his company so me, my dad, and couple of his colleagues a doing some IoT soln to that...end goal is to be able to view the temp,etc(along with some graphs and all showing history) on a web browser on ur phone or something
There‚Äôs also some vpn stuff happening for communication between the pis and the server but my dads handling that
I‚Äôm programming the client and the server stuff
In python so it‚Äôs easy thankfully
Right now, my server just takes the data and writes it into a file
What‚Äôs a mean stack?
One way chat
Oh and I‚Äôm using udp not tcp
Ohkaay I‚Äôll look into that
Python easyüëçüèª
Wait mean stack is all of these?
Actually...this maybe useful
WSS?
There‚Äôs no need for angular tho
The server os is centOS
Graphs possible in angular?
üëçüèª I‚Äôll definitely hv to look into it
Thanks üëçüèª
Github.io?
What‚Äôs normal github then?
Oh wait like a fancy website
Dif ui compared to normal github
Seriously, what song is that?
And it works on iPhone üëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèªüëçüèª
On up but still
*obvio
Wait seriously?
It works quite well on safari
Ur phones slow I think then
Perlinnoisefield and burst paint doesn‚Äôt work
Nothing happens
Others work nicely
Wth
And it looks like hair
Ya it does resemble it
Even u started with i3üëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèª
Ya same here...waaaay too much time
But it‚Äôs amazing once u get used to it
If u ever find the way to copy and paste from vim to system clipboard, let me noe...google dint help at allllll
I‚Äôm using terminator
No yanking normally copys to vim‚Äôs buffer...google says to copy to system clipboard, vim should hv the +clipboard functionality (which default vim on arch doesn‚Äôt hv...u have to install gvim) and do ‚Äú+y...‚Äù+y never worked
Ya but it‚Äôs too big for me
100+ mb
That or figure out how to ‚Äú+y
Once u start with i3 u use a lot of vim
Atleast for me
No using mouse
It‚Äôs kinda useless in i3 unless ur using gui apps
No like the whole idea behind i3 is to not use the mouse so much
???
Lol why?
No fix?
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Hey for that android app, ur using client-server architecture noe? Not peer to peer
Ok
And when u were programming the client server part, did u come across a problem where stuff sent by multiple send calls ended up combining somehow and they get received by one receiving call?
Lol I‚Äôm using simple socket programmingüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Mine isn‚Äôt a chat app, data is sent only when required and not always
Ya I googled how to make one...no one said anything
They were like ‚Äúscrew it use this module instead!‚Äù
And I want to send like 3 json objects or 5 at max
For now atleast
Ya I‚Äôm coding stuff
No one by one
This uses tcp or udp?
But if the data is huge even tho it‚Äôs 4 objects then it‚Äôs kinda stupid...and I don‚Äôt like doing that it doesn‚Äôt seem nice
For the app what ur using?
Like which protocol?
Array of 200 mb size then?(hypothetically)
Oh I‚Äôm using python btw
Wait one sec
Hypothetical scenario
It took a very long time to find thisüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Ok I guess In udp u don‚Äôt use http
Yup
Our college rite?
Any prerequisites?
Cyber security methods or whatnot?
Well, it is a workshop so maybe not
Although why only 6 ppl?
Dude what evaluation?
That group
Sec lab evaluation team
Dude where did u do ur internship?
Oh
What‚Äôs the company abt?
U finished the app?
No not the college one
Tho
*this
Lol then how I‚Äôll search?
Btw have u used arch on ur pi?
I want to use it as an access point in my room...how do I do the access point stuff in arch?
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
Any idea what package?
Oh ya I remember that diary
Thanks
Btw there‚Äôs a good markdown note making app thing called boostnote for Linux...it‚Äôs pretty good
U can also write code snippets but I haven‚Äôt tried that
Ya I get what u mean
My dad brought a new router and for some reason my laptops only getting ipv6 address in Manjaro, not ipv4
In windows it works fine
Yaüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
If I disable ipv6 in the network setting on manjaro, it says cant get up
*ip
üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
Whyyyyyy
Ya ik but whyyyyy
Why does the network related stuff on my PC always screwyüò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠
*is
What did u do for that company anyway?
No like what exactly?
Damn this sucks
Remember unrealüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
That much itself was hell
Programming part is interesting that‚Äôs all
Dude for the college app, the chat part, u used a recycler view rite?
üëçüèª
I‚Äôm still learning
Memory safe? Like if u hv 1000000000 items it‚Äôll load the whole thing to memory?
Either way, I‚Äôm doing ui stuff
All this is using normal java? Or some android specific stuff
And this stuff
Oh ok
Shawshank üòÅüòÅüòÅ
Wow u actually did itüòÇüòÇüòÇ
He asked me
Nope
A 3 days trip  to Mangalore is being  organised by our seniors from 28-09-18 to 30-09-18 .The total expenditure will be around 4-6k. If u are interested, dm me or Sanobar. also ask anyone from our class whose not in the group. A head count on the number of ppl is required by tomo morn. Oh and getting attendance on 28 and 29 is not 100% sure for now, so be interested at ur own risk
WthüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Screenshots or no screenshots?
No like of the code
Ok
What small?
Both my labs have 3 functions, I‚Äôm carboning the whole function
What‚Äôs discussion?
Ok
And in procedure should we tell what all we dragged and dropped and all?
All my algos fit in one pageüòÇ
What comes in conclusion?
Recommendations as in? Like if they are doing the same thing how would U advice them?
Did u use PropertyValueFactory or MapValueFactory for putting data in the table?
Any idea which is better?
U can specify where to render the graph in jupyter, like in an external window or somewhere else
Live editor doesn‚Äôt work for me
Dude for the search field thing, did u get it responsive? Like in mine, when i type something it displays properly, but it doesnt update when I delete the search text...it only updates when I type something...did u hv the same issue?
Nm I got an easier way...whenever there‚Äôs a text change, set the predicate
Dunno if it‚Äôs good way tho
What did u think?
No no
That later
Ya I saw that, u have a spinner rite?
U add a spinner object in the observable list? That‚Äôs possible?
And normally connecting the list to the table? Nothing different?
Why dint u use onEditCommit()?
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
I want to see that part of ur code after assignments r over so don‚Äôt delete
Idiot onlyü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Dude how to u set like call this function when increase or decrease spinner? U use onAction?
How did u link changes made to an item in the list to reflect on to the table?
I‚Äôll show in college
U reached?
How did u add itext?
Maven?
Too many files if u download from sourceforge
If u do use maven, send me a pic of the .pom file, especially the dependencies for itext, I‚Äôm getting confused some kernel stuff is there
What‚Äôs ur LD part b first q answer?
Tutor can enter *only if* S is there
But if S is there then anyone can go with him
H can enter if S is there
So CHT no
Then why H can go only if S is there?
If HC is possible then only H is also possible
I did this in the truth table
Ya
What does that bank link say?
theres no bank in this
The third statement is the confusing one, since it‚Äôs says CH is possible but the seconds statement says H can only go with S
How is there a don‚Äôt care in this?
How?
T is a valid input
U do care about T
T can‚Äôt go alone
He‚Äôll go to jail then
If he goes alone
This is confusing
Because if u read the q, it says all other conditions r 0
Not don‚Äôt care
In the last q says u output is 0 or don‚Äôt care
But this q says only 0 otherwise
What‚Äôs ur truth table?
I don‚Äôt have 7 11 13
Oh ya 7 is HCT
Oops
Damn it but H has to go with S
Wait a sec T can only go with S not H/C
If u take organisational hierarchy, it makes sense that T can only go with S, he‚Äôs just a tutor
Everything except CHT makes sense
S has master key so whoever goes with S can enter
That‚Äôs even more complicated
Ya
So combination of ppl
So where S is 1 it‚Äôs good
And HC
Cuz of condition
IKR
So is HCT possible?
HC is possible then HCT is also possible
It‚Äôs like if H and C combine they become S
So HCT=(HC)T=ST = 1
IküòÇüòÇüòÇ
So answer is this except 7?
Unless this is possible
Or think of it another way, which ever combination satisfies the conditions (regardless whether there are extra ppl) then that combo is true
That way CHT is true
Or we‚Äôll ask sir on Monday
We‚Äôll do thisüëçüèª
Ya
Because this is how u do the last q
Somewhat
Since >= credits is pass
Not just == credits
With this I‚Äôm getting H as don‚Äôt care
Or cancelled whatever
A=S, B=H, C=C, D=T
How did u make the hashmap? U hashed they key?
Ya u only found out sometime back in class...ctrl+Z noe?
Background foreground
?
Context?
Bash?

For tht gene q in DM, there‚Äôs an inbuilt function in python which gives me all the sunsets of a setüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2 lines of code
But then q is asking to find time complexity...how do u find that for an inbuilt function?
üëçüèªüëçüèª
I should still startüò≠üò≠
Ya but they won‚Äôt give the code only what the thing does

Dude for the MIPS walla q in COA assignment
Is it possible to get the MIPS rating as 4.somthing?
Did u do that q?
Any idea how to do it? I did it but I‚Äôm not too sure about the answer
He also dint do
My answer somewhat makes sense, but 4.something MIPS is kinda low
I have APC, DSA and M3
Pakka?
Circuit is huge tho
üëçüèª
God noes
I don‚Äôt care
He said maybe
Maybe he mistook god noes
Dude for APC, did u include screenshots of the entire program?
Basically what all screen shots u included in the question
And that appendix thing
And did u get the eq for math first q?
What answer u got for COA last q?
So u added individual MIPS values and took the time given in the q as the time required to execute 20 instructions or whatever instead of time required to execute 1 instruction
Why though?
No that I got
Why in the sense why add MIPS and why did u take it as time required for x instructions = value in the table?
I took time required for one instruction = value in the table
One instruction of that type
U did this
Ayioo see there are 20 load instructions out of 100 noe?
And they gave execution time is 90 nanoseconds...did u execution time of 20 load instructions as 90 nanoseconds or execution time of 1 load instruction as 90 nanoseconds?
Then shouldn‚Äôt u multiply by 20? Like 90*20 in denominator
U just did 20/90
Formula is like Instruction_count/total execution time of that type right?
So 20/(20*90*10^-9*10^6)
Here u did 20/blah blah
I dunno...that‚Äôs why I took execution time of all types of instructions
In denominator
This
Nope I got 4.9 something
Close to urs
That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs confusion here
Ya that summation thingy I think
Keep 100 it‚Äôll be easier to understand
So then which is rite?
So which is right?
Why did u take all the CPIs with same frequency?
*calculate all CPIs
Oh
How did cancel CPU freq in MIPS calculation? MIPS formula doesn‚Äôt have CPU freq in it
Some qs in the slide take execution time as CPU time
So CPU time for one Load instruction is 90ns
Wait a sec...they used CPI to calculate CPI?
But my answer using 1/(x+y+z) thing is without the 10^12
?
Whoops
Wait
Ok it matches my answer
Remove the 10^12 part
4.950495
I solved it using the method they used in that website
üëçüèª
Ya
Math 1st q?
For the cipher walla dsa q, u used any data structure?
What‚Äôs in the structure?
U did it like cli args specify which file to encrypt/decrypt rite?
How did u explain this for 4 marks?
I‚Äôll finish DSA and then see
I hate DSA
My programs r utter crap
Cipher thing is fine, apart from a struct which does nothing...my plagiarism thingy is very stupid, although it‚Äôs less than 100 lines
yup ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
Ya this only, but final answer is weird
Wow ya so according to q m/s = kg
Wait it‚Äôs given numerically equal
Chuck all that is this rite?
What did u get?
U stuck in mathüò±üò±üò±üò±
Dude what‚Äôs ur graph for math first q?
Wth, whts ur solutions?
Hmm...I dint think of using diff
Solutions tho?
No not graph actual solution
I used combo of wolfram and some other math site
Also in the quadrangle there is a poster with the link I think for details
Can u send the link?
Only the old innovation challenge is there in the normal thing
Aey that‚Äôs last years one but the format won‚Äôt change noe?
They do want the whole thing to be broken down into those categories
No no categories in the sense the budget, further scope and stuff
Along with the idea, we need to focus on that also
That‚Äôs another mistake we did last time
We focused too much on the program and neglected everything else
The themes are there on that poster
Dude this time we r playing to win
So no slacking off
Same
Take note of this
Oh if u find a nicer looking version of the pdf then send it to me also
Which?
Send noe
Apparently recognising breast cancer is easy
From medical point of view
Not programming point of view
God noes
U said breast cancer has most
Cuz there‚Äôs no human error
Wait r u thinking of changing the topic?
This exists u noe
Hmm I‚Äôll ask
There r some ppl who r doctors and don‚Äôt know shit
Example, for colonoscopy kind of operation, which idiot puts the instrument in the patients mouth and expects it to go to the intestine?
This happened in my sis college
Ya I‚Äôll talk to my sis when she gets home
Dude where did u get those pics?
Scans walla
Send a clear pic of one now
Dude send a pic of an image
The topic of finding out whether there is cancer or not is very broad
That Wisconsin place got data from a procedure called fine needle aspiration (the images that come up in that process are in shades of pink) and the ones u showed were black and white
Dude send one pic
I want to show my sis
Use the phone camera
Cuz the Wisconsin stuff is used for waaaaay more specific things not just whether u hv cancer or no
And these are used for simple classification
Which is what we want
One sec
Ok talked to my sis
She said these things are called mammography and can only tell u whether cancer is there or not
The Wisconsin shit is used for telling what sort of cancer what type specifics which has a looooottttt of medical information
And this is waaaaaay simpler than the Wisconsin thing
She‚Äôll go to the library tomo and get more info on how to read a mammography
I‚Äôll ask someone Ik how u would approach the feature extraction stuff from images
üëçüèª
Found a paper that explains what we want
Feature extraction from mammography
And at the end they also end up classifying itüòÇ
No code, but good starting point
ill send? or did u already come across it?
Read the full thing then we‚Äôll discuss what to do, what tools to use, etc
There are stages to it, basically pre-processing, feature extraction and reduction, dumping in a classification algo
This is needed so we both don‚Äôt end up doing the same thing and wasting time
And don‚Äôt end up using different tools
That 160 gb has benign images rite? Benign is non cancerous
If it says that even benign thing is there the it‚Äôs fine
Sis found out somewhat
Ok now I want to torture and kill the creator of Realtek
Windows is having problems now
ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨
No signal in mine
Even when I‚Äôm next to the router I get like 1 bar
U read it?
No no no cropped stuff
What happened to thisü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
Ok so u do pre-processing I‚Äôll start with the feature stuff and look into it
Btw u forgot about histogram equalisation
More in the sense not the 160 gb one? And this has the cropped stuff?
Wait cropping won‚Äôt effect anything rite? It‚Äôll still work even if we put a non-cropped one
Despite feeding cropped images for training not effecting anything, we still need to make sure the program works with full fledged images also, cuz that‚Äôs our actual inpit
*input
We use tensorflow?
If we r, then I have to use windows...I tried installing tensor flow in manjaro yesterday, manjaro broke
Why nn? For image processing?
Manjaro dint boot... I had to install proprietary drivers and cuda support, that broke it
I was thinking we follow the steps in that paper
First we‚Äôll go with the paper thingy, cuz the steps are there, then we‚Äôll dig deeper with nn
Provided we have time
Dude give me the link where u got the license keys for clion noe
While installing tensor flow u used Vonda?
*conda
I‚Äôm installing in base
My q is whether what conda installs and what the website says is the same or what
Cuz I installed the stuff the website said
How did u install it?
I‚Äôm installing in windows only
But u used conda rite? Website says to use pip
What‚Äôs the code to add 2 numbers using gpu? I want to test and see if it works
What‚Äôs the use of name parameter?
Oh
It‚Äôs taking a while to add
Which version r u using?
1.10
Couldn‚Äôt install 1.11 using conda
Installing using pip dint work
Dude it‚Äôs still running
Ok
Ok it works in shell
Fast
But Jupyter no
Why?
Ok then installing cuda was not required at all
I just ran conda install tensorflow and done
Tensor flow is used only for neural networks??
But can u do stuff like use numpy functions on gpu? Like that Gaussian blur thingy I told u about
Can u execute it using tensorflow? Or should u code the whole thing urself?
Can void pointers point to pointers?
üòëthat day u said single pointer is fine
Say I want a linked list that can hold arrays as well as integers
But since void can point to anything, can‚Äôt it also point to a pointer?
Ok another q say I have int**, while mallocing, I only have to do malloc(num*sizeof(**int)) rite?
**int
Both places
Ok
**<var_name> in malloc
Wolfram also gives c=7 but also y=0 and gives the answer in terms of some lambert function
Dude for the ‚Äúverify the correctness of the derived solution‚Äù what should we do?
And plotting ignore any complex parts which come?
U won‚Äôt get nice graph, it‚Äôll be too pointy
Harvard guys says when m is prime and same in congruence relations, the problem can be solved using linear algebra
