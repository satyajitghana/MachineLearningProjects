Biggest joke
😂
😒😒
😭 did you finish studying ?
IM just glancing through all the slides
Not learning anything actually
hmm
ya
this sucks
Mech sucks... totally
Donno wt to learn also
PV diagrams, four stroke engines, and that refrigeration system.
at least these.
Refrigeration system...wt will they ask?
you don't have old papers ? 🤔
No😳
You deleted this message
Have one...in that it isn't there
This I had...only one
this is where they asked the vapour compression refrigeration
3.b it's there no ?
Oh yeah🤦🏻‍♀
😌
ya
read that
I didn't learn that...I'll learn now
or learn
yeah
Thanks!
😊 you're welcome.
Question 4?
photovoltaic cells
write about that
Diagram?
arre write photoelectric effect
And explain
Ohhh
diagram that pn junction thing
Haan...that's ik
Easy
yup
I finished glancing once
Now I'll learn
😦🤐
😭😭
C'mon...u will also finish
I don't know anything...just seen what's there
I'll try to 👍

oooh he's fast. vayu, huh 😂, find that horse, i want one.
It's ur bro...u go find him
😂😂😂
70km/hr from t=0s to t=3s
😂😂😂
but a average horse goes from 35-45 km/h
Yeahhh
Verryyy fasy
fast
😂 we need to find this horse.
Sumanth sir has it
😕 oh.
kidnapped ?
😦 how could he do that.
Ur bro...u find out😛
you did B1 ?
IM seeing the questions now
aaah ok.
This is Newton forward difference na
yup
equally spaced.
u started assignments?
but they never said to specifically use newton-gregory forward difference
so you can use anything
not yet.
they have asked
see
😑 B 3.1
ya
just saw
in the net they have given it as the same ting..i mean its given as NFD
net ?
internet
google
what's given as the same thing ?
gregory newton and NFD
it's not NFD
it should be Newton-Gregory only
😑 sumanth sir never told that, he forgot gregory
BUT the steps and all are same
//pages.intnet.mu/cueboy/education/notes/numerical/newtongregory.pdf
we'll ask in class then
arre
its the same thing
he didnt write the full name of the interpolating technique
ohhhhhh
😂😂
then we can do
but terms are huge🤦🏻‍♀
ya
last question also
terms are more
MATLAB questions, you don't have to do anything
directly we can write it off huh using matlab?
no need of typing?
copy paste the function from MATLAB
okieee
and then you'll get the function as output noe, type that here in word and answer the questions that follow.
like the previous assns...we need not show stps is it?
*steps
they never said to write the algorithm
so why to do so much work.
fine then..i'll try
```simplify(poly)```
Wt?
It's there in the program onlt
oh ok
it didn't give a t^5 so I thought you didn't simplify it.
Whole multiplied by t is there
ya
but that doesn't look nice
try ```pretty(poly)```
Wht😂
try no
Niceee
ya
nice 👌
Understandable format
pretty format
😁
Yeahhh🙃
Wt to do for the other sub questions
whatever they've asked to do
😂
I mean how
😌 I'll see later.
still sleeping
White board??????
Woe
ya
for writing stuff
I can see that I have solved something
*u
```x(end)```
Yeah I did
aah ok
B1.
And that sure looks like math B 1
Yeahhh
Done solving?
kinda
have to type and all.
Ehmm
and make things "pretty"
😂 havn't started typing noe
But u have the answers no
😅 uhh
Then😐
oh wow 😂
U also do na
I have a feeling something's wrong
will do later
yeah got the same
but the graph is weird.
Yeah same..graph IS weird
use less step size, it will be fine then.
Ur still up?
yeah
Studying
no, YouTube
will be sleeping in some time
Liar
or not, not sure
🤦‍♂ not lying.
Liar liar liar
🙁
😂
☹

Wt were u doing till now?
till 1 am, maths assignment
Coz that's what we think u do
then just whiling away time
How many done?
and that's not true at all.
Questions
🤷🏻‍♀
the debate is left, B2 is left, and that last one have to ask sir about the smoothness of the curve.
Ok..tell me how to do B 3 other parts tmrw
Now I'll sleep again
😭 no it's not true.
okay good night
Chill yr😂
😊
Good night!
Written ECE Manual?
not yet. sleeping. 😅
How many assignments done?
none
Math?
debate
Debate is left
Huh
yeah
Can u send screenshot of the answers...IM not asking for the PDF or anything...take it from ur phone only and send...no problem
Pls send
?
busy with physics.
When can u send?
not sure
after that i'll be doing ME
Take some 5 mins of ur time and pls send
🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
you did EC and Mech ?
Mech  IM doing now
ECE I got something on the net
oh ok, same here.
Send math noe
🙏🏻
you finish mech and ec
don't depend on me
Mech I will.. ECE I donno
Math tho...🗡
EC I could help
after finishing mine
Oh thanks
But I seriously want math da
Im not able to do
what in maths ?
B1 and B2 ?
Yeahh
here
happy ?
Yupp
you can solve it noe ?
Thanks🤗
Yeah
Did u do ED 2 nd one
havn't started, but will do.
Oh cool
Tell me after ur done
there are two DE's for this, one for t = 0hr to t = 120hr and other for t >= 120hr
🤦🏻‍♀ok
ECE
Got anything?
doing . . .
Okay
Done with ECE
?
doing . . .
Ohkkk
U got the output waveform?
yup
Cool
does it work ?
Oh shit...this is positive clamper..isn't it
And answer is negative clamper na
yup
Haan got it
Wt to write for specifications of components
copy paste the data sheet of the component
Im doing online
It's not there🤦🏻‍♀
Send what to write na
Wtf
the data sheet
Exactly...show na
search for 1N4007G data sheet
or whatever diode you used
I'll get on internet?
yep
Got it
Thanks
Done all assignments?
Over?
😑 ya noe, i finished A2 also.
Dude. IM just asking casually... didn't have to get offended🤐
🙁 still on mechanical
and then there's maths A1
after that ED manual draw
ECE?
that's probably it.
done
except last Question
Send noe pls
I have
here are the working circuits
just simulate them that's it.
I don't have multisim
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat ?
IM doing online
ohk
not sure if the online Multisim can open Multisim files
It can't
We can only construct and save online itself
In our account
🤦‍♂ why why why online
you have the circuits with you ?
I mean the solutions
I have the installation file..but lazy to install
wtf 😑
I thought you didn't have
now go and install then
I got only that clamper ka thing
and then use these files.
I have to do ED and math still
like from beginning ?
No..ED documentation...and math debate have to search
ECE full I have to do
mech ?
Done
fully done ?
Haan
aaah then you have time to install multisim
go and install
Ahhh...okay
👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍👍
🤦🏻‍♀🤞🏻
It's easy for boys to tell to wear anything and come
😒
red is not ok ?
Not about the colour
It's about WHAT to wear
😂 arre anything red.
remember we have workshop
Exactly
Thats y we can't actually get ready and stuff ..
you can change in break
Someone convince sir not to take mech workshop..
We'll get ready properly and come
🤔 good idea
but whose gonna convince sir ?
BTW we havn't bunked any workshop
so there's chance he might listen
Yeah...
CR's ?
And he told we can bunk any one workshop...in the first class he tols
Remember?
ya
They can
We can try that tmrw...
okay 👍
so what do we do if we bunk ?
Tell in the group
go somewhere ?
Again the same question will arise..."go where"?
😂
and the loop continues
Forever and ever
😂 home
If we decide on something today itself...we can bunk the whole of tmrw and go somewhere
Just saying😛
now that this has been taken care of, anything else you'd like ?
Everyone agreeing to it
Maybe?
arre they will.
we won't attend.
Sure?
ya
one day they'll agree
or we can talk to sir.
But we need to know now na...

How did u?
proxy servers
Ahhhh
i can do it as many times i want actually
Bad boy
😁
want more crushes ?
No thanks
Too much to handle already
🤣 aah have fun
tomorrow physics lab, viva or the experiment ?
Experiment
☹ viva is more funnnnn
Since when is 1 and half hour if mind blast is funn
since last viva . . .
Oh my god
Nooooooo
It's too much...
He should reduce the time
U gave away the plot for me
told you
👊🏻
did you write the physics manual diffraction grating ?
Noooo
Did u?
yeah, wanted to check the values
finish it then
Show me the calculations
IM getting confused...I sat to do it on Friday itself
how did u get TR
write for one value and send
16.5 + (20/30)*0.5
show me the wavelengths that u got
since 0.5 degrees is divided to 30 division
right most is wavelengths
okayy i'll see
all colors seem right for me except blue
doesnt match with theoretical value?
ohh..u got that for blue?
ya
do your calculations
i'll do
im taking g section friend ka value..mine was wrong na
okay
whats LC?
tomorrow we should get it corrected
1 minute na
yep
1 minute 0.5/30 degrees
0.5?
oh haan
because i wanted everything in degrees
okayy
i can keep in minutes and do the calculations na
umm you'll have problem later converting minutes to degrees
basically when you do calculations you need in radians
you want to convert minutes to degrees to radians ?
you can though
calculator has a degrees with minutes and seconds waala option
like you put ' and ''
yeah..i can do that
you finished ?
Yeah
and also got it corrected ?
send me the values 😅
My first wavelength was not correct...I have to check everything again
He told me to come tmrw

How to use ode45?
Also..'quad'?
```Q = quad(@myfun,0,2);
where the file myfun.m defines the function:
%-------------------%
function y = myfun(x)
y = 1./(x.^3-2*x-5);
%-------------------%

or, use a parameter for the constant:
Q = quad(@(x)myfun2(x,5),0,2);
where the file myfun2.m defines the function:
%----------------------%
function y = myfun2(x,c)
y = 1./(x.^3-2*x-c);
%----------------------%```
```[t,y]=ode45(@vdp1,[0 20],[2 0]);
plot(t,y(:,1));
solves the system y' = vdp1(t,y), using the default relative error
tolerance 1e-3 and the default absolute tolerance of 1e-6 for each
component, and plots the first component of the solution.```
U urself..is the crush ehhh🤣
😂 whose crush would I be.
I'm the best friend part

And u?
cancer ♋
Sure..I'll listen to u
😅😛
😂
Finished?
finished what ?
😂
Preparing for tmrw?
umm not exactly.
I was in college
going home now.
there's manual for curve fitting ?
Wt were u doing?
He has done in class...I learnt
like as in partial derivatives and all ?
and minimising that error function thing.
No..
Not that one
asking people how their MATLAB was.
then ?
How was it?
quite simple, only interpolation manual will come.
Finding co -efficients of the linear equation and polynomial
and how do you plan to find the inverse of a 4X4 matrix ?
NBD is there?
I don't wanna learn
i mean 3X3
yeah
MATLAB
🤦🏻‍♀
it's _manual_
gauss jordon ? 😂
Im doing all that
you are ?
😮
U told only interpolation manual na...why do need all that?
*not
🤦🏻‍♀😬
yeah, today's all exams it was interpolations.
ask someone in automotive, I don't know about them
I know none
Advice lol
😂 okay tell what kind of advice you would like to hear ?
Anything u wanna say
advice for you hmmmmmmmm.
lemme think
Think think
😂 lol this is difficult.
you are perfect the way you are.
i wouldn't want to see any change in you.
😅
Ohoo... enough
No one's perfect
I said the way you are now is perfect, see my definition of perfect is different. I'm defining it relatively.
But.. something will be there...for sure
Right now
😅 right now
😂 I'm in college
can't think
For what joy?
tomorrow we have physics right ?
got bored at home
Yeah...so?
i have to study noe
U don't study at home?
i dont wanna be that guy who thinks tomorrow is EC and comes prepared for that.
i do i do, lately just not feeling like being at home.
U wanna be there..where ur heart is
umm maybe
havn't seen her.
Yeah..I know
😅
Y
she might have external today ? I donno. havn't talked for a long while.
Ahhh..she has exam today..
Pritam has. So..
oh ya, same batch.
Workshop
even if she doesn't. she won't probably see me.
*doesn't have exam
aaah ok.
She doesn't hate u..does she..to not see u
no she doesn't. but she won't specifically be like to meet me.
Hm.. sad🤦🏻‍♀
yeah 😕
Go study now
This is sooo cuteeeee
yep yep yep
😄 ikr.
I've studied for lab
should study theory now.
Ohh.. awesome
I'll start studying at 12 or something
okay cool 😄
😇
you know what happened ? 😂
i met her.
coincidentally she came to canteen and I was already there.
nice timing though
😄
And then what happened?
Anything interesting?
umm no
😅
that was about it
Ahhhh...
Atleast u saw
Happy?
yeeeee 😄
😂
Calm
😁😁😁😁😍
😃
Enough blushing now
👻👻
done for tomorrow's exam ?
Kinda
Just saw all the experiments
Been sleeping the whole day..down with fever
True😊
😦 get well soon
Yeah.. taking antibiotics since 4 days☹😭
tc
😝
Hmm
_take care_
🙄😂
😂
Sure..and I have to🤦🏻‍♀
Wt all do we need to write in ECE practicals?
same stuff
aim
apparatus
formulas, circuit diagram, expected graph.
No analysis, discussion nd all that stuff na
nope
Ty😁
U did that thing for Rishika?
what thing ?
Her status?
😂😂🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ I'm excluded
Sadly😂
🤦‍♂ yeah
sad.
Done with ECE.?
not started
😂 makinf a music visualiser now.
Wowww
Uk everything na
😒😒😒😒
nothing like that
Lol
Im scared about ECE here...and ur doing some other work
will study
after doing this
and then sleeping for 3 hours
What's the mark distribution?
then study
Btw write up and conduction and viva?
🤷‍♂
🙄🤦🏻‍♀
🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
You wrote mock right?
yeah
but I don't recall
Then?
He didn't tell?
Approx?
same as physics I guess
14 is viva
exp1+exp2
that's all I recall
Thik hai..✌🏻
😁 k
If it's a single experiment?
then 14M in that only.
What 2 experiments are they gonna combine?
Any idea?
zener and logic gate
i had got that
Characteristics or Voltage regulation?
and one was CE config.
voltage regulation one is not there I think
Really???thank God
Single experiment?
i didn't see anyone do that
yeah
Multisim is there?
yeah
simulation for 741 Op-Amp
For which experiments?
CE, CB
and logic gates I think
Huhhhh...we have to learn all that?
Gone only
yeah
Pritam told it isn't there
i had got that in mock
U did simulation for logic gates?
🤷‍♂ maybe.
nope
Clipper clamper..single experiments?
no
clipper might be paired with transformer
Rectifiers?
yeah that
And simulation for that also?
could be
what's the big deal in simulation anyways 😒
Damn..im gonna do bad tmrw
If there is no practice...then it is a big deal
still you can do
make the circuit and sumulate that's all
I hope I get reallllllly easy ones
😂 yeah
everyone hopes the same
Diode characteristics is with what?
🤷‍♂
😑 you will be damn lucky if you get pn characteristics though
one of the easiest exp
Ikr..but what will he with that?
First 4 and logic gates is peaceful
yeah
hope for the best
no idea.
Yess🤞🏻
I have to learn all others now
Woahhhhh... awesome
😁 will have to improve it by quite a lot.
Do it after tmrw plssss
Seeing u so relaxed about tmrw...im getting scared
☹
Serio
I'm gonna sleep
we'll pass
Ufff🤦🏻‍♀
chill
There's no simulation for OP amp
Confirm
ohkay
Transistor also ...it's not there
what simulation is there then ?
Clipper clamper rectifiers
If they r combined with any other expt.. simulation won't be there
aah ohk
then I want clipper/clamper with simulation
that shit is easy
😂🙌🏻
Op-amp is the best
😂 whatever you want
wish for it.
😂 I had wished for LCR and I got that
soo ...
Yessss🤩
I wished for same thing as mock...and I got teh same thing
yeah 😂 it works, confirmed
Yesss😍
I hope the same charm works tmrw as well
yep 😄😄😄
let's hope so.
Op-amp my friend in g section got.. simulation was there it seems
oh ok
Yessss
😂
Oh damn🤦🏻‍♀
😂😂😂😂😂
now you get it
Yeah....
Now Ik..
IM spoilt ..bcoz of shoban
😂 yeah that guy.
he damn smart
In these matters
If u stress enough on something...I can know ..I can't see anything in one view...I mean .. understand those grosss stuff
😂😂😂 ohkay
Yeah😂😂
You deleted this message
Ohoooo
🙄 why
but why
Who knows what's running in her mind
Just like that she sent?
yeah
Or was there any conversations bfr?
wasn't anything related nope
we didn't talk much the day before
Ahhhh...r u friendzoned?
😂 yep
Achooo
🤦🏻‍♀
Welcome to the world of being friendzoned (maybe) by our crushes😂
😂 oh
*maybe
Not sure
My case is opposite I guess...the below part
First period is true...true love wala
😂 both end up being _friends_ eventually.
Hopefully not🤞🏻
if we are just friends then why send me that
🤔
There was ntg with that photo?
I mean ..a question or something
How is it ?
nope
Wow
it's a gif file
the heart pops out and shrinks
and pops out again
Then that's not at all a friendly thing ..
It's a girlfriendy thing
a beating heart
in short
yeah ? 🤔 this is so confusing
She's just avoiding relationship
But she definitely likes u
😊 I hope the liking part is true.
😄
Im almost sure it is
When she talks to u..do u look into the eyes or something?
yeah and then I forget what to say
🤣
Wow
So romantic😂
She also looks into ur eyes?
yep
and then we both smile
and it gets awkward
That's a good sign
😂
Really good
😂
Once while giving sociology presentation..I looked at him...and then gone..

i do
Whyyyy
Just whyy
we'll go to H section it would be so niceee
even Pritam is there noe
😄 your best friend

This is awesomeness to the next level😍😍😍🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
I finished season 1
😁😁😁😁 ikr. worth investing time.
Yeah ..it gives u satisfaction
U showed it to her?
oh cool, 😂 and i don't even know what that series is, just saw that it is quite popular.
yeah, as soon as i had finished making it.
It's emotionally draining dude...💔
What was her reaction
😊 she liked it.
//satyajitghana.github.io/ProcessingJS/RainDrops/
and this.
She obviously know that ur into her...like too much
🤦‍♂ yeah, she knows, its 6 months since we met.

🤣
Serio
I never get bored...
🤦🏻‍♀
😂😂😂
ridiculous right 😂🤣😂🤣😂
U can change the gender ..it applies to me too
😂 yeah sure
🤐

umm no
I slept whole day
and yesterday whole evening and night
Y don't u say that u woke up now

that's a better way to say
😂
I woke up now.
🤦🏻‍♀
🤦🏻‍♀
Btw.. reduction to first order DE is there for the exam?
nope
reduction of order is not there.
that's the only thing that's not there.
And transformation..that y= vx thing?
that's homo
geneous
so it's there.
That's just one of the methods to solve na...he didn't do in class though
anyways you know how to solve it noe ?
Yeah
😂 why you worrying then.

U know who
accha
Apart from him..g section ppl🤦🏻‍♀
oh
g section
ya
cool cool
let them eat
😂
🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
I literally have the whole math notes on my phone
Sending it to who ever asks
and I'm doing this.
Woah..ur so cool
what does this look like ?
a shrub ? tree ? weed ?
A tree with twigs growing?
Tree
Bonsai
hey how was physics ?
That's a digital pic?
Physics was fine
yep, computer generated, using an algorithm.
fine ? not great ?
I might lose marks in numericals...so...
I  atttended all the questions though
👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
aah that's ok, mistakes happen.
Yeah...🤦🏻‍♀
How cute are they😍😍😍😍
Awhhhh
I can't stop looking at them

Mendel's experiment for dominant and recessive gene
noooooooooo 😂
That ratio
yeah, whatever that was
Yesssssssssss
no please no
Mendel was a genius
now don't start that mendel experiment
and his botanical garden thing
U should help me with coding
Deal?
you studied JAVA
Or...... should I?
I have learnt none of the languages
but but I remember you saying you learnt java
you didn't learn ?
😂 no you shouldn't
Nooo...I was never a cs student
C++ in high school🤦🏻‍♀
yeah so
so you know
Don't really remember
in summer  ?
Sure..
theek hai. 😇
i'll be learning C
and Haskell
and Java
Ahaan
From where?
Online?
books books ! books are way better. i am worried i will catch bad programming practices if i start learning onlie
*online
Woahh..I don't even know what's good 🤦🏻‍♀
Ur dp😂😂😂

Looks like I did
😂
Not u...but u know whom I'll ask...and u know what

Hahaha... good
I finished 13 reasons why season 2 also
Have to wait for one year for season 3
🤦🏻‍♀😑
yeah, I came to know 😂
Yup😏
Watched guardian of the galaxy with bro
aah cool
😂 I watch weird movies
Yeah
I have to start studying tmrw
Like?
Bad Genius is a Thai movie 😌
The only thing I have watched in that list is diary of a Wimpy kid
I finished all the movies from that last month during assignment 2
😁 I watched all parts of that. and even read the books.
I haven't read the books..I don't even have them
😌 I could get long haul book so I printed it like a proper diary with spiral and hard front and back cardboard cover
Woahh
that was me in class 10th I think
😅
When I was a kid..I thought it was a silly book to read
it is 🤣
Movie was good
It still is...yeah😂
okay, see ya, I have to finish this movie and then sleep 😌.
Sure...
Cya
not me, he started it.
Wtvr🤦🏻‍♀
but he did
. . .
U continued na😂
😂 haan toh, shuru woh kare aur mai favour bhi na return karun.
Uff... seeing all that.. we'll go mad
😂😂😂😂
Have*
God
U 2🤦🏻‍♀
Ehhhh?
Wt do u mean
whenever I used to say - hum bacche hain yaar
bacche paida karne layak ho haya hai tu aur bol rha hai  baccha hai
Wth😂😂😂😂😂
yup 😂😂😂😂
IM bachi
accha ? 😅 you sure
Yup😂
IM innocent
haan haan
maan liya
😂😇
kuch bhi matlab
kye re😂
ye waala joke accha tha, aur sunao
aye...since when is truth funny😂
😂 after joining this college everything seems like a joke

ayeee non of them are cute
except the first top onr
that's also a little scary
😂😂😂😂
I just got them as wallpaper for my phone
😂 are these blue people from Twilight ?

a lion and a lamb can never be friends
Yeah..so they are gf-bf😂

its a 😸
those little cute creature
*creatures
🐈🐈🐈

Big cats😂
They are tigers

She is a human only
He is a vampire
I don't remember😂
😂 blood sucking creatures
They are cute too
This one looks like ur girl😂
Eyes and the pose
😂😂😂 but the fawn is more cute.
Of course😂
C++ works on netbeans ide na
haan
NetBeans works with Java, C++, C, JavaScript, CSS, HTML(not a programming language)
looks fine to me
Idk..IM not getting the output🤷🏻‍♀
you sure you are using the right compiler ?
C++ needs g++ and not gcc
For C I thing I downloaded gcc
Think*
I guess you are using cygwin ?
Yeah
//netbeans.org/community/releases/80/cpp-setup-instructions.html
maybe read this
you just have to point the g++ location to cygwin g++
i dont have NetBeans right now so can't exactly say how to do that.
hey you have codeblocks too
use that, simple
Yeah..it didn't work on that either
you downloaded code blocks with minGW right ?
there are different version of codeblocks
Bro did it...I'll ask him
why does it say Untitled.c and not Untitled.cpp
Oh yeah🤦🏻‍♀
//sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/17.12/Windows/codeblocks-17.12mingw-setup.exe/download
download this one
it has minGW preconfigures
*pre-configured
or use VSCode like me
What's that?
😋😋
a code editor
yeah but you have to configure the g++ manually
aah cool
this was the problem ?
Umm..I just want to learn basic C++ right now🤷🏻‍♀
Yess🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
weird
it still should have worked
😂like me and my life
anyways g++ is strict
so that might be the reason
stop everything, throw errors ! abort ! abort !
🤷🏻‍♀
I don't even know wt u r talking about
Maybe I'll learn in the days to come
meh do whatever you want, i'll punish you later when you run me
Like some life-threatening situation😂
😂 yeah, you'll soon find out, why i said c++ and c are very strict.
start using pointers, and function pointers
If I don't..I'll ask u anyway
yeah sure
Yeah..I'll do it gradually
I'll start with basic basics😌
I'll want u teach me how to use the command prompt and all🙄
*to
command prompt ? or unix shell ?
i don't think there's anything to learn in command prompt
but the unix shell, there's a lot to learn
Idk..using command prompt we can do some stuff na
Yeah..I've seen I teach Shikhar I guess in class?
hmm yeah, but i dont really use it much. expect for compiling and running programs
Maybe u can teach me that?
its just doing what your IDE does automatically for you.
```g++ hello.cpp``` and to run it ```./hello.exe``` or whatever the output was.
not that important though
i would say unix shell is more important
Okayy
Umm...what's that again.?
Im poor in these things uk
the command prompt in linux is called the _shell_
Whats Ubuntu?
Type of Linux?
*flavour of linux
linux is like the inside of chocolate, and ubuntu, manjaro, fedora, centos, redhat, etc. are the wrappers
Meaning?
at the core of it, they all do the same thing, just a little differently
Nice way to explain something
Which one do u have?
😁
antergos
i mean right now, i am on windows
the other laptop, antergos
Okayyy
We need to learn to use those OS on our own right?
yeah
you can do c++ programming in linux too
I've seen u do C
yep, and c++ isn't much different
i'll be doing C after i finish this JavaScript thing and this Android thing
That's really great
I have to first learn basics of coding...and then all this complicated stuff
DP😂
😂 yeah I liked it.
so
Fine fine😂
and now this 😂
lion and lamb can't be friends, a dog and bull can't be brother's.
😂 no idea what's happening.
Ferdinand😍
Sure they can😂
That will never happen I believe😂
😂😂😂😂
For sure😂
😂😂😂 I know , even after 10 years when I see 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971 *69* 399. 😂😂😂😂 I'll still smile.
😂 woooooo how about I make a programs that counts the number of times 69 occurs in Pi
btw how's C++ going ?
Omfg😱
Yeah yeah..ofc do that😂
Im doing an online thing
😂😂😂😂
//youtu.be/LFU381e_nys
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
😅
trying to make some matlab tutorial videos
That's really cool
Happy birthday Mr Coder❤️🎉🎉
ooo coder, 😊😊😊 Thank You
Yess
Welcome🤗
What's this
_basins of attractions_
Meaning?
like in Newton Raphson when applied on a complex function, it will never be able to find the root, and rather oscillate, based on the initial guess, and if you plot those oscillations, or so called "chaotic" behaviour this graphs pops up.
😝 I'm making videos of linear systems and Newton Raphson today
Wow
Looks like someone's not gonna take a break these holidays
and then tomorrow it will be second semester MATLAB
Niceee
yeah no 😂😂, I'm counting my days, with daily targets.
yesterday was a break
😝 cuz birthday
Thank God🤦🏻‍♀
Give ur brain some rest man
Ur nerve cells will get frayed
hmmmmmmmmmmm
but but I sleep

Sun rises early here..I woke up
you get to see the sun ? the red waala ?
Yeah
Behind the mountains also
never been there 😅
Ferris wheel ?
Yeah yeah..wtvr
🤔🤔🤔 that's quite possible, but where will you get a colour changing fabric ?
😂 or we can attach a RGB strip and change the colour according to a light sensor.
Oh god
U are thinking of a possibility to make it true?
it's is possible to change color based on something.
but not the pattern thing
well maybe u can think about it🤷🏻‍♀
Wt r u trying to do?
a chat application in android, that would work with our registration numbers
Oho
How does it work?
ok so for now, i'm working on the login and registration, i'll make the chat later, you just enter your registration number, name, email and pass and then register, then you can login and chat with other people of our university.
are you asking the technical details ?
Looks like something cool is happening
I'll ask when I have some knowledge about it
😁
//drive.google.com/file/d/1cugEhjLh_6EF0sANB68xNbj__ax92omY/view?usp=sharing
🤦‍♂ it's hard to deal with so many stuff going on at the same time
How the hell u do such stuff😱
U really are very intelligent
🤔 the way a normal person does. nothing fancy.
😂 but definitely not a single monitor thing. i have to use a external monitor
Duhhh
I don't even know what you are talking t
p
Oh🤦🏻‍♀
😂
My phone is charging
It's at 63 now😂
woah
😂 me too at 63 now
🙌🙌
😂 cool
😂😂😂😂
Oh yeah?😑
😂😂 just kidding
kya reg, tum log toh seriously le liye
you'll have a bright future, don't worry.
😂 mera kya hai, mera toh chalta rehta hai.
🤨
Aage chalta hai tum logo ka
but still that's true
this
😂 the being stupid on a daily basis
😌
Give me an example wr ur being a stupid?
aaah wait wait
Yeah?
😌 20 days and still didn't finish this project
if you could read this code, you would have been shouting at me for being that dumb
😌😌😌
U give instructions like that to urself?😂😂😂
Clearly I can't..and im the dumber one here
yup 😂 there's more
Wowww😂😂😂
Nice😂😂
Actually it's a good way
Reminder kinda thing
What the hell😱😂
😂 not sure if I'll ever fix those. but in case someone else sees my project he/she will know that something has to be fixed
😂 still not fixed, because if it works, don't touch it if you don't know why it works
Im sure u will complete it in any case
Huh?
i am not sure why it works
deprecated APIs usually fail.
i havn't looked up its newer API yet, because it still works
Idk what API is
oh, it's like a middle man, you can ask him to do a task he'll do it for you, you don't need to know how he'll do it, but he'll do it for you and give you the results.
Oh that's nice
Now ik
😂 just don't write that in exams saying it was told by me.
😂😂
Btw..wt will we learn in the next year
Data Structures, Logic Design, Discrete Maths, OOP, Advanced Programming Concepts, Distributed Systems
Haskell, Java & C would be used
Ohh.. should we learn it before hand?
it would be helpful if you did.
learn Java 👍, Haskell is different, Java is Object Oriented, haskell is Functional Programming, everything is done using only functions, so you might find that weird at first
Ok..I'll see to that
Thanks🤗
😊 You're Welcome
😇
😂 now i feel little less stupid
Bcoz im more stupid😂
because I was of some use
🤣
Nice...
Shyamant jobless😂
Can u chat now on this?
not yet, today I'll try to finish the chat DM part.
Good good
See..ur no more stupid
Who's me and who's Satyajit😂
😂 all of them are me
I changed my name latet
Achaaa
Can shyamant respond now?
yeah sure.
but then current problem is the new message is not updated on the screen, you have to go back and open the chat
)
🤦‍♂ I need to learn socket programming now.
😭 so muchhh workkke
🤷🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
Ur doing it to learn...so work😂
Better than me.sitting idle not doing anything
it's like two people talking to each other directly, what I'm doing right now is like using one sided communication, either the server talks or the client. so if I send something to the server then I need to ask the sever everytime , hey did you get my new message, but the sever can't say the user, hey you've got a new message when there's a new message.
idle ? 😒 you can't live being idle, too boring.
😂 and you, being idle
😂😂 that can't happen
Shyamant reads ur msg now?..but he can't see it directly?
Is that what u telling?
Ik..that's y im bored
Looks likes it's happening😂
he can see the messages, but he'll have to ask the server every time, if there's a new message for him.
hey is there a new message ? hey is there a new message ?
very annoying
Ohh..so that's what y were typing there..
Got it
Congrats topper
😂 i'm second
again
Harshit of H section got 645
ya
U Seriously did this?
Damn
😂 yeah, because i was feeling bad that i was second . . . . twice . . . . now i feel better.

Oh god🤦🏻‍♀
U were in the same group na
yeah, so we don't know what happened there 😂
😁 keep improving, and be consistent, that's they key
Yup
🤗😇
Re-evaluation?
😂 how bad could someone's luck be, that they failed only her, and not us
that exists ?
Ikr😂😂
That can't even happen
Yeah
😱 1500 per subject
that's another form of torture
It's 5000 in other clgs
woahhhhh
that's far too much
imagine how many burgers you could buy with that
😋
Exactly🤦🏻‍♀
Their intention is that no one should apply for reval
Enough to last a day or two😂
lazy people . . .

Lazy clg.."University"

😝
Does it matter?😂
It's just a celebrity
😂 ohkay
😂😂😂😂
Yeah
Wt u upto these days?
right now, im solving this book of C, authored by the creator of C himself, Dennis M Ritchie
Wowww
Cool!
it's a nice book to learn programming for even beginners.
Ohhh
U have the book?
Or online?
nah nah, I bought the book.
it's nice to give credits to the person who wrote the book.
Good!
i mean how would I feel if I wrote the book and people just download it.
*a book
I hate online stuff
I like holding a book and reading
yeah same 😊
Yeah
U don't do any other stuff other than programming huh
and watch movies
yeah probably that's it.
😋
and estt
eat
and sleep
and sometimes go out
No Interest other stuff huh
to see if it's day or night
😂
like ? whatelse is there ?
that I would like ?
U should say
Oh God🤦🏻‍♀
hmm, I would like to go travelling, once in a while, but right now I am very very poor.
_once in a while_
oh yeah I'll definitely work on getting out of my comfort zone after engineering.
During the course also u should take ur mind off sometimes
oh about that, did I tell you before ? I'm not in Bangalore
I'm at my grandparents house.
in Odisha
Ohhhhh
That's good then
But u still took ur books with u
yep 😋
only this C book
and another Java
that's it though
😛
That's it?
Im sure u will finish it by the time u go back home
And u will buy more books
that's the plan for now
Seeeee
Don't be so studious
🧐 this is studying ?
😂 I was doing what I love to do.
doesn't feel like I'm studying
Yeah...great
It's so effortless for u
Totally u
Oye..do u know to hack Insta accounts?
umm not exactly
lookup social engineering
i can do that
What's that?
Hack?
🙄
umm no
social engineering is different
but you do get control of that account.
Do u know to do that?
yeah, though it takes time and patience and I'm not in that mood.
Achaaaa...and I won't ask also..chuck
Go do ur C book ka work
😁 ohkay
though search about Social Engineering
it's a very easy thing to learn
just need time and patience
and Kali Linux if you want to get into penetration testing.
Wow
Idk all that
I just wanted to snoop into someone's account
Yeah..I'll see
phone or pc ?
Insta account da
if android, then look for Android RAT, then you can literally see their phone screen and also control it.
Wt do we need to do that?
Google it, you'll know. you need a software that makes an Android app when installed on victims phone gives you total control
Yeah..saw that
But I can't do that now..
Installing an app in their phonw
school friend, 😂 because I used to do this shit in school.
Heheheheheeeee
See
Popular kid
see I can tell you what you can do, but I'm not doing it.
😂 yeah even so much that the principal had a talk with me.
😑 for something that I didn't even do.
but I found out who did it so it was fine later.
Woah woah woah
That's better 😂
Yaaassssssssss
Urs?
nah
though she is our pet.
grandparents take care of them.
😅 I've come here after 3 years I guess
they were kittens back then
now they've grown up
Ohhh that's nice
Enjoy with ur favourite things 😂
😂😂😄😄
Cute one😂
😁😁 she's so cute.
choooo cutee
😂
And u don't kill it
Ik😂
Yeah yeah😂
How did u get this?
//kea.kar.nic.in/cet2017/daily_verify_20jun.pdf
Ooooo yeah..cool
there was this curoff analyzer thing, not sure where i found it, then i got this list
and this is the list of CET numbers and the corresponding name list
Yeah.. our computer was filled with this shit
Great
same
😂 and a list of colleges
and its cutoff
i didn't even expect to get this college, because its cut off was like exactly 6k, and that was also the reason i thought it was a good college, later now i see that the cut off went upto 10K
U can basically find out anyone from our clg
who came from CET, yep
Yeah..that was a shock to me too..I wish I had got nitte or something
This clg was bfr nitte
I didn't have expectations on this clg coz I wouldn't have qualified looking at the cut off
wow, same, actually in the last minute i changed the order of NITTE to below RUAS, since some people said that NITTE is not so nice
But atleast the cultural activities is better
and also because the working professionals i met say that during interviews they dont really like people coming from a VTU background.
i'm fine without them 😂
Like.. we'll get placed from our clg now😒
the students here arn't that active in organizing events properly i think. not many attended our technical bootcamps.
😂 that depends on us now.
It's not fun
C'mon..If there were more fun activities..ppl will participate in these events too
but who here is to blame ? the college usually doesn't do the work, the students organize by themselves
It's an overload of only technical stuff
That's the whole point😂🤷🏻‍♀
🧐 we have got some pretty lazy students then
Yeah...we should be doing more fun stuff in the future
See Anusha S P 's rank😂
TH148
AA555, she's 8199
that's a different Anusha
How couldn't I find🤦🏻‍♀
because her name is S P Anusha
Oh damn
Yeah🤦🏻‍♀
Peace
Wow
U gotta chill rn😂🤦🏻‍♀
🤣🤣🤣
😂 kitty is so busy with his friend
Awwh leave those 2 alone😂
🤣 I love playing with them.
oh and the cow loves getting neck rubs
*calf
still a kid
Yeah I could see that
We have a farm too
Who doesn't?
I mean everyone except who don't get allergies
Hey..wanted help
Is learning python important now?
yeah ?
no
I mean not for college
Me and my friends wanted to join a course...it's 13k
2 months
yeah sure
python is nice
Is that fine?
yeah
Okayyy
Where is python useful?
ML/AI, Data Sciences, Web Apps, Linux programs
pretty much everywhere
even android apps
Ok cool!
So.. learning python bfr java is fine?
yeah totally fine
How did learn python.?
At home?
yeah
like i am using TensorFlow which is a ML API, so the more I use that, the more I learn python also.
basically I've been learning languages because I had to
like just making small little programs makes you understand the syntax and all
that's all you need to catch up a new language
Yeah..
Should do that
and moreover Python is just using C in its inside
I'll join the classes then
pure C
and C++
Ohh then probably I'll understand something atleast
Which is the software for that?
yeah but Python won't give you control over any of its memory.
C++ was developed from C na
for ?
yeah
Python
there's an official Python website, you can download there.
Google python
you'll know what to do
Achaaaa
Thik hai
Thanks yaar
yeah np
🤗
sure
yayyyyyy I love seeing happy faces 😊😊😊
Ayee🙈🙈🤗🤗

oh ohk
😅
Yeah🤪🤪
I use light theme
M not a zombie👻
😂 howwww
Like that only😂
Yeah right
😌 hmm yeah
Ik
Same experience here
Hey
Will they teach c++ next semester in clg?
hmm maybe
Not sure?
yeah not sure
from the slides that I saw, there wasn't any C++
U have slides of next sem also?
3rd and 4th sems
you want ? 😂
Yesssssssssss I do want
oh wow 😂 sure
Send then😁
//drive.google.com/open?id=1IaW9pO4G4RilQvUO206WvnJPjgvI1XYR

We have java in the next sem ?
yeah
its there somewhere
Yeah..saw
oh ok
and haskell too
Ohh..
we have discrete math next sem?
yeppp
wowww okay
It will never happen to me 😂
😂 me neither, but if that happens, that's would be my exact reaction
Mine too😂🙌🏻
yeah, a one that has a cat on it 😂
no a kitty

Happy kitty sleepy kitty purr purr purr
What's a mutex lock?
it's very hard to make examples of mutex locks,
like it's:
person 1 : if you explain the meaning of mutex lock I'll be happy.
person 2 : if you'll be happy I'll explain you the meaning of mutex lock.
that's a Mutex Lock
😅 it's stuff related to programming
Ohooo
Nice concept
Even if I ask u where it's used..I won't understand
🤦🏻‍♀
ohhh it's used in Threads
oh ya
you need to know threading
😅
you started learning Python ?
Heard about it😂
Eyebrow threading😂😂
😂😂🤣🤣
My bro told me to learn OOPS first.  So c++
ohh cool
Python also has OOPs though 😛
But C++ is basic na
yeah true . . .
Yeah..I'll make my basixs strong first and then higher level
so you're learning C++ 17 ?
17?
yeah
there are different standards for C++
C++ 98, C++ 11, C++ 17
No clue🤷🏻‍♀
so are they teaching STL's ? Namespaces and stuff ?
Namespace yeah
Expand STL
ohkay so it's C++11 and later
ohkay that's great then
Standard Template Library
Yeah probably that only
Sheldon😂
Oh yeah u are Sheldon 99
9%
99.9
😅😅😅
Sheldon seems like a nice character then
I've never watched the series
Ohhh
U should
What's that on the left?
I donno some post-it by someone
not my desk
I thought it's urs
stoned santa apparently
Is that ur laptop?
Where are you???
yeah
😅 I'm doing an internship
IIM Bangalore
Woah nice
Internship in what
Android Developer
Ooh nice
Deep
😅 yeah
😇
Btw what's the situation btw u and her?
same as before, maybe even further away now.
way further away.
Whyyy?
Don't u guys talk more now?
not much nope
maybe once in a week or something
We both are in the same boat🙌🏻😒
😕
Urs is better then
yeah and I feel bad that she's the one who starts the conversation cuz I can't.
Woah..that's good then
I actually gave up hope and not even talking since holidays started
😥
probably things will get better for you once college starts
just 11 more days <winky emoji>
About that..I don't want to talk to him unless he comes and talks to me first
😅 but but either one of you should start taking right, if not him then you.
Btw I actually saw him 2 weeks back in clg when I went to pay fees with friends..I managed to royally ignore him even though we met face to face
oh damn
Donno🤷🏻‍♀
these holidays increased our distances even further.
even with my friends
Very much
Only ppl from our class with whom I spoke to in these holidays are u,Anusha, Rohit, shoban
That's all
btw how'd you pay ? cheque/cash/<something else> ? I haven't payed yet, and because of office I couldn't go. I'll tell mom.
I haven't paid too
I just went with Anusha and shoban that day
U can pay either online or by giving a DD
yeah similar story here, I've only talked with Sejal and Rishika and probably that's about it. now I just talk with my office colleagues mostly all the time
ohkay cool.
Office
Damn..u sound like a responsible adult
it's actually a lot of fun
not much work there
and I get to work with all sorts of technology.
Yeah that's what u love
So it's obviously fun
that and also the joy when what you made actually works.
😂 and then finishing bugs in it.
Yeah...sounds like good work
Btw u get paid na?
What's the stipend?
3K/month
wasn't after the stipend
the name IIM was enough for me to join.
Of course yeah
Anyway when is it gonna end?
I'll go to college normally when college starts, and probably Saturday and Sunday go there for discussions. until Sep 30th, so a total of 2 months internship.
Ooh niceeee
😂😂 yayyy mine is more
Woahhhhhhhh
Btw I was playing on YouTube😂
So I wasn't using Gaana much
😂😂 we've come so far with technology, still YouTube doesn't give the feature to play only audio in background.
Ikr
We can use split screen though
But it's not that comfortable
yeah true.
fluffy cats everywhere
Sure
I'll have puppies also
Along with cats
😂😂 yayyy

Me too
Completely done hug

so now anyone can install the app and start messaging it works
What's the name of the app?
havn't uploaded to play store
just need to fix some small bugs
then I'll upload
here pre-alpha
my name on the app is Satyajit Ghana
How do I login?
I didn't register..wait I'll do
you can type whatever you want in email
I mean I am not doing email verification yet
Oh okay
The messages repeat
yeah it happened when I was talking with shubham also
initially
then it fixed itself
Yeah
Great job dude👏🏻👏🏻
😂 the problem is I don't know why it fixed itself
Maybe it was just a glitch
it happens initally when talking with someone. only the first few messages.
Yeah...saw that
So..who's Satyajit Ghana 2,3 and all
😅 there was noone in the beginning, so to test it I was talking with my own accounts
Yeah😂
U used sanobar's UMS number😂😂
yeah, will change the name 😂😌
Yes yes😂
Ahh it became clear now
Chuck
🤣🤣🤣
"arabiansea"
😂😂😂
nice one
Seriously???
That's good?
😂 i find it funny
Damn🤦🏻‍♀
Too true
Hey
Do u have DSA lab manual?
yeah maybe
I'll have to see when I reach home
Okay
But why aren't u still home?
just reached home, will see it later though.
stayed back helping her install NetBeans.
Ohoo😉
Yes yes
do we have to submit printout or submit soft copy for DS&A lab ?
for LD lab toh it's soft copy only.
We need to give a printout..when we asked her,she told that we should do exactly what we did  last year
oh okay
☹
Why?😂
soft copy is easier.
take printout is another headache.
no printer at home.
Actually yeah
But we don't know about what to do to that Logic design lab..let's see
Neither do i🤷🏻‍♀
Thanks!
This isn't the one that ma'am showed us in the lab actually
hmm then we'll have to ask for the new one tomorrow
this is the one she copied onto the desktop
Oh okayy
See the question..it's different
it's kind of correct, it says random number generator
possibly the one she showed was someone's lab report ?
Yeah..but thats only one question..that too it's not the one we did in lab
any update on what we should do for DSA lab ?
i forgot to ask ma'am
😂 anyways she was scolding us, so i forgot
Oh I donno
The cr should be knowing..but yeah ..it happens that he doesn't too
So I'll do it in the same lab document that we already have
What works?
some questions like that works
I'm working on making it learn from WhatsApp conversations
that's kinda difficult, cuz sometimes I chat in hindi, sometimes in English
Wow
U don't need to be in this clg
Serio ..u deserve more
😅 don't want to leave it anymore
already am so used to this
😅 but cet says this is what i deserved.
Oooh nice nice
No way
Can u think of any limits for random generation program?
*limitations
yeah many actually
it's not really random, it's pseudo random
Yeah?
Please tell
if I were to use the program in two different systems at the same time, I would get the same numbers.
so it's not really random
Yeah..I saw that
In my laptop
And more pls!!
read on linear congruent generators
as far as I saw the source code for rand() it uses that algorithm
any limitations for that generator is a limitation of rand()
simple
_wikipedia_
I actually saw a paper on that,when I searched for limitations
Thanks😇
Hey,are those programs that shyamant sent in the group?
you just had to practice then
there's a readme inside
Okayy
😂 what did shubham say
He said he'll see and tell by 9
Why?
just wondering why he told you to wait till 9
🤦🏻‍♀😂
Idk
Hey
What program are we supposed to do for second lab?
DSA
Give me all assignments
😂 ask Shyamant
No
U give😂
😂 and who told you I was going to let you steal ?
😏
U😂😂😂
Urself
I said you to steal, not that I'll let you.
Yeah right😂
you started doing assignments ?
Not yet,I have to
hmm yeah, there are 6 ☹
I'm not at home since last week...like I have 0 time🤦🏻‍♀
Yeahh

COA
Thanks
Do u have any textbook for COA
Thanks🤗
Hey
Any textbook for DSA?

Nah
We don't even have the manual
and B section ? did they get the manual ?
I'm done with the manual part though
Nope
yeppp
🤗
look at the number of pages 😪
IK
Must be a very fat book na
yeah
and it's called "introduction" to algorithms
And it's 1000+ pages
Irony
yeah
Wyd now?
sleeping
Very good😂
I've been sleeping a lot lately
😂
Argh me too
I sleep almost 8 hours now
everything feels boring
Ikr
yeah same
life is boring
😪
Very very boring
all because of the stupid college
I watch TV series also
So... boredom reduced by some 1/4th
and it's stupid timings
and stupid attendance
30 by the time I go home..and I'm too tired to do anything
sleep right after I reach home, next day don't sleep
What???
Don't sleep the next day??
but yeah feels very tiring
yep, pretty much works, then on Sunday, sleep like 12 hours
it gets balanced
Oh my God
Ur not a human
How can u function without sleeping for a day
😂 you can if you practice enough
human body can adapt to changes
Yeah... but it's a long process
I can't function of I don't sleep for min 5 hours
If*
TT's are also nearing now 🙁
Yeah🤦🏻‍♀🤦🏻‍♀
What can they ask in APC?
sometimes I feel like I should just quit engg. do something else
I'm reading slides
That's everyday for me
nowadays even mom is like do Mtech and become a teacher don't join a company
Yeahh
I'll do that too then
U would become a good teacher
Don't go for a job unless u become an entrepreneur...u have an amazing intellect
😊😊 I'd be glad to be one
Teacher?
yup
Me too
But not  for adults
A school would be good for me..I love to teach kids new things
job satisfaction is nice for teachers
In my school in primary ...I was a tutor  to my fellow schoolmates..like my class teacher made me teach those failures
Yeah ..we can do what we love
They all passed😛

Yeah🤷🏻‍♀
My mom's sister is an headmistress

Ugh

Send that screenshot properly now
Why did committed come there btw?
🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ he just said it.
He told
"Satyajit asked me to date!!"
And he deleted the msg
And told me to ask u about it
i never delete messages
Shubham deleted this msg
This one
ohhhh
Yeah
no he was like everyone in our class is older than us, so i asked him your dob to tell him that not everyone is older than you
it all started because neha is a year old than him
and even shyamant is a year older than him
Wow🤦🏻‍♀
I still didn't understand why committed came
Was it Neha is committed?
What did u reply at the end?😂
i told him to look for juniors
Very nice🤦🏻‍♀😂
Instead of doing this..do one more whole new program and give me
😂😂 you do
it's simple actually
Yeah ik🤦🏻‍♀
But I won't do in Java
then ?
C++ ?
Qt ?
C++
GUI or CUI
CUI
Tell me where to find the answer to that logic design question
you Google it
Didn't find it
Tell me the expression that u got  initially before simplification
?
umm you tried ?
Yeahh
I wrote only the expression yday..idk
okay
if you write the truth table it should verify
that's one way to check if you got the correct answer
It's a tautology?
uhh no
Oh yeah..it can't be also
I haven't tried yet
Tell me where it is na
I'll see and solve this question🤦🏻‍♀
😆 ask shubham
its pretty simple actually
Stop Playing this game of telling me to ask each other🤦🏻‍♀
Then show🤦🏻‍♀
😏 aise kaise
The original question
Not urs🤦🏻‍♀
you google the right terms you'll find the right answers
It's there in mathexchange something
Solution isn't there
I already checked🤦🏻‍♀
you are talking about B1 right ?
B1 is ther
Yeah
B2 not sure
B1 only
Didn't find
arre hai yaar, theek se dhundo mil jayega
😌
I put it in that plagiarism check wala thing also
It showed only question
Solution isn't there
🤷‍♂ i got it still, didn't use any plagiarim check ,just a simple 4-5 word google search
I'm not getting🤷🏻‍♀
I found .. but it's showing..the question is on hold
okay okay, but but it's there somewhere out there.
I'm searching since half an hour
😭 i have to do DSA
U have finished APC😑
Send the link noe
Plssss
I'll finish atleast one question in one subject
🙏🏻
🤦‍♂
🙏🏻😒
yeah yeah
Pakka na?
//www.learnabout-electronics.org/Digital/dig23.php
Oh damn thanks!!
not exactly
read that link
I got that part .. manager cashier wala
I got different
are you considering that CH can enter ?
and can CHT enter ?
yaa i did
HC is possible then HCT is also possible
It’s like if H and C combine they become S
if you think in that sense then _they_ can enter
T can enter only if S is there, so no, and also H can enter if S is there, so only C can enter if all three come at once
So HCT=(HC)T=ST = 1
😂could we do that ? logically seems right, but it breaks the constraints
two of the constraints
Ik😂😂😂
Unless this is possible
logically possinle
CH = 1 = S
but contradicts the conditions
this is the discussion me and shyamant had
then that truth table seems wrong
Total 6 terms na
See this
A is superintendent,B is HOD,C is course leader,D is tutor
10
What🙄
How???
A can enter noe ?
with whomever he wants to
Yeah..
So..yeah..I need to consider him entering with everyone?
why is 1101 as 0 ?
yeah
It's not
It's 1110
your third last is 1 1 1 0 and outputs 0
* 1101
Like AB ,AC,AD,.. THAT'S ALREADY THERE
SO..ABC,ABD
I need to take that also now?
Yeah ..so that's ABD
yeah
you minimized your expression ?
K-Map ?
Nope
okay do that
the answer will have only 2 terma
But it gives the minimised expression in logisim na
after minimized
Oh okay
I'll see
yeah if you click on K Map it minimzes it
Haan
So 7 terms with A huh?
10
total 10
No wait..8
Yeah..got it
With A in the expression?
All 10 terms have A?
no
some terms are there noe like CH, CHT
where S is not there
your A is my S
Yeah yeah...
yeah
Okay🤗
Wth is it just BC +A
?
yeahhhhh
Oh my God
I was scared I did it wrong again
Thanks Satyajit!
😅
U did B2 ?

Thik hai
Wohi karenge😂
Main bhi nahi Jaa rahi
😋
good
so
kitna hua assignment ?
Math .. doing
LD I finished long back
Coa B1 restoring division done
DSA B1
APC..half done
btw for LD I did B1 using both methods Don't care and without don't care
today morning I added don't care waala
That's not needed anyway
I won't do
hmm
How many are u done with?
M3 and COA pura baaki hai
and APC thoda documentation
Math is okayish
DM also documentation is left.
Oh yeah..I need to do DM full
Rest all done na?
kinda kinda
Good
did coa B2?
yeah
How to do?
Please reach
Teach*
teach
0.2/time*10^6
and then summation like that
What's 0.2?
20%
is 0.2
Oh Haan...so it's 0.10 and 0.5
yeah yeah
Can u please send a photo of atleast one subpart
🙏🏻
Satyajitttt
Ummm ok..what to do for the next sub parts
reduce the execution time
by X% and Y%
so new execution time is (100-X)/100 * execution timr
and so on for Y%
if 90% is reduced
then 10% is remaining
that's why subtract from 100
got it ?
My X is 50
yeah same
So? It's half that's all na
so LOAD execution time is reduced by half
yeah
yeah
Same formula we need to apply with the changed execution times
yep
same thing with new execution times
that's tit
*it
Show B2.4
I won't ask anymore questions🙊
Thank you so much♥❤

Mud type?
😂😂
umm Google ?
My friend told me..she knows japanese
Okiee
So.. types of Pokemon's are the objects
These are all classes
When you start specifying the fields, it becomes an object
Yeah...mud type,grass type and water type
Yep
And also Pokemon type
That's also a class
Methods are move,eat and that stuff na
Yepp
Parent class
Yep
Name , colour and all are fields?
Partner class fields
What's partner class fields?
They are inherited from parent class na
Yeah
So the parent class has those fields
Percentage of water and all are fields in the sub classes
Yep
Water type
Okiee
When we write the inheritance hierarchy ka diagram,we need to mention fields and methods also na?
Yes
Like a UML diagram
Ohkayy
I hope he gives something like that...I'll be very happy😂
What's UML?
Something like this
Okk..
I'll do it the way it's given in one of the slides

There's a lot in COA
Those algorithms

We don't have pipeline
Arithmetic
Thingy ?
Booths algorithm
That one...that's easy
And then that repeated division
I was absent
Assignment waala
I don't think they'll ask that
It was asked in assignments already
They might ask multipliers
Then they'll ask those diagrams in data path
Diagrams ?
And also algorithm
No.. booth's algorithm
Yeah🤦🏻‍♀
I need to learn in clg
There's array multipliers also
You made notes in class ?
