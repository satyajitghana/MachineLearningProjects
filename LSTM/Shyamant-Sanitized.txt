Yep 👍
Hey Whts the model no of ur calculator?
991ES
Casio FX 991ES
Thnx
Hey after running powertop --calibrate
What should u do?
And can u send the commands to be run after installing tlp?
sudo tlp start
systemctl enable tlp
*sudo
After powertops calibrate?
Yes
Ok thnx!
Oh and how did u change how the icons and all look?
the icons is called numix-circle , there is a ppa to be added before you can install it.
There is another icon set called arc which is quite popular along with numix
I use numix-square and for the topbar system monitor I use gnome-system-monitor
And for terminal theme I use zsh+powerlevel9k+tilix+gruvbox
Ok thnx
No same here.
Install powerline fonts also
How to flush the stdin??

Flushing input streams is invoking Undefined Behavior. Don't try it.

You can only flush output streams
😂 and we tried fflush(stdin)
😂
I forgot to explain it to you how my program worked.
So if you want number of zeroes in any number find prime factorisation of it
10 can be made only by 5*2 so I find out the power of 5 in number n
That power of 5 is actually the number of zeros in that number
So let's take an example of 100
100=2*5*5*2=2^2.5^2
Power of 5 here is 2
Hence the number of zeroes in 100 is 2
Ta-Da
😋
So basically it's the number of 5's that appear when u find the factors of the number?
Yes, the number of times I can divide the number by 5 will be my number of zeroes.
10! Has two zeroes but u can divide 10 by 5 only once...
For factorials 10/5=2 and then 10=10/5=2 2/5=0 and then 2+0=2 hence 10! has 2 zeros
???
What the heck
Ya no idea
Whts the ans?
-1 in C and Java
Oh ans is on top
Wth?
Try -13/4 in python
Wait lemme do in pc
I tried in pc python
Python 2.7.13
-13/4 gives -3 in java and c
Python is weird
What did you write in chemistry lab manual ?
Except observation table
And graph of course
Nothing else at least in the hematite exp
Why does the python prompt say GCC in the beginning ?
There r dll and .o files in python I guess it has something to do with that?(those files r there in the windows version not sure about Linux)
.o files are c object files, hmm, will see tomorrow.
👍🏻
What all do we have to write in cs lab manual ?
*type
Only the first one
Analysis, discussions, comments ?
Not sure hv to ask ma'am Tomo
Okeh
Are you guys here yet ?
Not yet
Did u get tower of Hanoi?
Not yet, I was in my java classes from 3pm till now
Chirag told to think in a mathematical way
Using PMI ?
Hmm I think I get it
I'm still stuck
And no arrays it seems
So I'm even more stuck
Try Hanoi for 1disk then 2disk then n disk then n+1 disks
I will try after I have dinner 😅
👍🏻
One of my friend who comes to the same java class did it in 15mins . And he even displayed the rods with discs rather just printing numbers
😳😟
Any idea how we can get that recursion video ? That guy explained it quite well.
Ask chirag he'll probably hv the link
The Hindi ones were from code ninja
how do u choose which disk move will be the most optimal one?
That hindi guy said don't worry about that, just worry about your base case and the induction case thingy
Our aim is to move n-1 discs to middle rod first
Then move the last disc to the last rod then move those n-1 discs from middle rod to right most rod
//en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Hanoi
Tower of Hanoi - Wikipedia
Base case chirag told...he said it depends on input
I think we should watch some videos of people solving Hanoi physically
But that'll be human thinking
Oh
Just to get an idea of what kind of strategy they use
Ys
Ya
Expert human people in Hanoi are basically robots following some algorithm
Ya
I wonder if Chirag asks us to solve a Rubik's cube next, 😂
😂
I gv up, saw a video from geekforgeeks and the soln is hilarious😂😂😂😂
Send link lol
I did the Hanoi  now trying the keypad
Keypad is easier than Hanoi
Ya I finished keypad
//m.youtube.com/watch?v=YstLjLCGmgg
Hey wht did u write for analysis and discussion for first exp?
Or just send a pic
Searched the internet
Nm I wrote something off
keh
C Debugging contest is on 14th
And it's only for juniors, Chirag will contact them and let us know about the timings
Get your ID card today
We definitely need it tomorrow
I left long back
45 AM
Crap
I'm asking chirag if there's another way
Yes do that quick
We will show this
How did u get it??
We went to admission department he said we can take a photo of Id card but he didn't give us your ID card
Wow Thnx I told chirag he still has to reply
Ur still there??
He said the pic is fine
Okay
But
The college is in kengri it seems and if it's not near peenya we can't go to the college and then go there...I hv to go to the college tomorrow since I hv tht sheet with me
Dr. Ambedkar Institute Of Technology
Near Jnana Bharathi Campus, 2 Stage, Nagarbhavi, Bengaluru, Karnataka 560056
080 2321 1506

https://goo.gl/maps/CpBJgFYbzTS2
~30 minutes from here
Being RS 140 just in case
Ya it's possible I can leave the sheet with sambar after cross checking in the morning
*sanibar
The other CR
🤣👍
Stupid autocorrect
Do you know of what packages people got at nineleaps ?
Nineleaps?
Yes ?
No wht is it
The company that came to our university for recruitment
Nope
Come to Brindavan bus stop
Umm we have to leave now
Any *one* if you write our names *neatly* in the certificate and take a xerox. And if you are going to University get that form that Chirag mentioned.
Whts the former? I don't hv the message
You have to take a form from admission department
Its called cultural or medical leave form
In that you have to write the contest name hosted by and the periods missed that day.
Also you have to attach photocopy of the certificate
I'm not coming tomo...not feeling well
Did u give attendance for comp lab? Even I forgot...can u try asking ma'am to give attendance?
Ok I will ask her to give attendance, even I didn't give
//m.youtube.com/watch?v=i7sm9dzFtEI
Got attendance?
Whoever attended viva got attendance

😂😂😂😂
I don't understand at all😂😂😂
KTHXBYE
Dude tomo chem lab rite
Yep 🙂
I just saw your message
Lol chuck it
They took it?
They are demanding for a letter that says that we took permission from a faculty before going
So we will type and print a letter and make Ami to sign it, then Manjunath Naik will sign then Dean will sign, then we get our attendance
Think of what to write in letter
😓
How do u do the mean value theorem pdf excercises q 2 and 4 on the lmvt part?
I got 4...I want to cross check the 2nd one
Lemme se
See
Is the answer 22 for 4. ?
And the 3rd of rolled theorem
Ya same
Ok trying 2. Of LMVT and 3. Of RT
assume g(x)=f(x)e^-x
Ya I still don't get it
I don't understand the hibt
How'd you do LMVT 2.
Looks ok
In the 3rd of rolled we hv to prove tht the function goes to 0 at some point c
And at that point slope is x axis
Parallel to x axis
f'(x)=f(x) that's like e^x=e^x
Ya
But how do u prove it?
You can prove it using the hint
Put g'(x)=0
You will get f'(x)=f(x)
And also g(0)=g(1)=0
But without the hint I donno
How do u just assume stuff like thay
This is not needed I think
Which part 😂
This part
Else you can't apply Rolle theorem in the first place
Look
Oh ya
g(x)=f(x)e^(-x)
Technically g(0)=g(1) that's all not necessarily 0
g(0)=f(0)e^-x
f(0)=0
And the same for g(1)
Oh
OK how do u assume this
Assume it's rite noe? It's already proved off👍🏻
I think we have guess that part using the fact that f(0)=f(1)=0 after seeing this you can think of a exp function as exp play nice, maybe something like this
Especially the f'(x)=f(x) part
OK assuming the hint how do u get this? Once u get this u get the ans
In(0,1) If g(0)=g(1) then there exists at least one c belongs to (0,1) such that g'(c)=0
And also e^x is continuous so f(x)e^x is also continuous in [0,1]
Ok
How do u do this?
Find potential drop at 7 ohm let it be equal to V7, now 60-V7 is the voltage that 12ohm,6ohm and the other 12 ohm will get, so then you can find d current and use kvl kcl thing
Or directly use kvl kcl
This is method is mesh analysis right ?
U should use mesh analysis
Mesh analysis is used to find loop current whereas kvl is used to find branch current
There's a duf
I ll have to read it again then 😕
Do you happen to have another scientific calculator ?
I lost mine ☹
Nope
Sayan guy doesn't hv?
☹ no
Ayiooo
The shop near college might hv
Ask shubham where he got his
After comp u can buy a cheap one
I think I will borrow it from my friend for tomorrow
👍🏻
Try it on falstad
?
//www.falstad.com/circuit/
4 ohm
🤣 I doubt they would ask this
OK got same
Ikr
I x Rth
Is it like potential across A and B is potential across 12 ohm?
I=2A?
The current sources thing
And will the current source affect the voltage across the 12 ohm resistor?
Ofcourse
OK so how do u find it?
What are we doing in this question ?
Source transformation?
Finding load current
Using thevenin's theorem
Well then convert the voltage source into a current source first
Then the current source you get from above you can convert that back to a voltage source then back to a current source
Oh
Then?I'm
*then
Now you can add the current sources
Current sources are in parallel here
Yeah that's why
If they are in series then also add?
It depends on the direction of current but yeah
Now convert it back to voltage source
You will get resistors in series
V=10/3
10*3 no ?
Oh ya
Now what?
Now it's done 😂
Vth is 30?
Hey what did you do to RL ?
Open circuit noe when finding vth
Oh ok
You only had to find Vth ?
??
This step ya
Try simulating it in falstad
And rth also
Forget it it's too Complicated
It's supped to be way easier
Supposed
I think it's right...u simplify the entire circuit to this and then do everything
You can always use KCL KVL
To this to be exact
And now start applying thevenin's theorem
Yeah
Which lecture numbers will come for electrical ?
Aey the slides in the cd and the slides which he uses r dif
Till slide 13/15 I think
Ok
?
a
Ans Is b
Uhhh that's weird
If it has infinite internal resistance then even if I short the AC source there shouldn't be a large current
Idk that's the ans written
Hey u going tomo?
yeah, if there are a very few people then i will come back home
Aey tomo business is there
I don't want to go to college
mom won't allow, she is like you go if your teacher allows then come back home
U live near ish so it's fine
You guys went home ?
Going
//hastebin.com/evipamuqet.cpp
this sucks
Dude it's waaaay too big
i will have to ask our teacher, i tried to fix it, but its segmentation fault
Somethings wrong with my Ubuntu
yeah something is wrong here to, the video is still loading 🤣
oh darn
something is up with gnome
Asked chirag he said malware
what do we ever do to get malware on ubuntu
God noes
no idea what resetting would be
try adding another user and login through that user
use TTY to make an new user
that ctrl+alt+F4 screen
Safe resetting -> booting into safe mode and doing something
aah the single user mode
go to grub and boot with -s flag
at grub press e to edit the kernel boot parameters
add -s then press ctrl+x to boot with single user mode
that should take you to a screen which you get when you press ctrl+alt+F4
To go to safe mode goto grub menu, advanced options and select recovery mode...now waiting for chirag to reply
Hey how do u access Ubuntu partition from windows? I want to backup atleast my assignment
you cant access the terminal ?
Tty thingy I can
Oh I just copy it from there rite?
yeah
Nm
Ya
😅
you can access windows partitions from ubuntu
hey you can also run nautilus if you can access ctrl+alt+T
Tried it...ended up logging me out for no reasob
use tty to login
after you login at TTY, run startx
which should give you a GUI
Wth...now everything is fine...I booted into Ubuntu and everything came back
Idk whts going on
it could have been problem with icon cache
i thought you already rebooted once, these problems are usually fixed with reboot
The change i notice is tht the third party fix which I put for the wifi driver is gone
I did...thrice
did you do apt-get upgrade ?
even my third party wifi drivers are gone
ubuntu installed some of it's own drivers now
I did tht but it was like run some dpkg configure command or whtnot...I did that before contacting chirag and the safe mode thingy
I did it in TTY
Whts TTY full form?
tele-type
in olden days they used to have a physical type write that used to print the terminal
that was the real terminal
nowadays we use a terminal-emulator
all out terminals are emulators, the real terminal no-one uses anymore
Typewriter???
yeah like a physical type write that prints your prompt
Woah
the real terminals ^
32
Holy crap

Hey how do I install gdm themes? I got one nice one from one website called gnome-look.org but it's an archive...no idea wht to do
there's a guide description of the theme
Where?
Remember I told u tht my pc took a long time to reboot? After the whole icon thing tht got fixed for some reason
definitely a update
1.- Extract the zip file to the themes directory i.e. ~/.themes/ or /usr/share/themes/ (create it if necessary).

2.- To set the theme in Gnome, run the following commands in Terminal (i.e Ant theme).

gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme Ant
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences theme Ant
yeah tested that works ^
Basically wherever u put Ant u should put the theme name rite?
after you copy ant to themes, you should see ants in gnome tweak tool
Ant is a theme right?
yeah
Gdm tgene
Themr
Theme
ant is also a creature
Ayioo ik
In this context
Insect
doze damn ants took away muh sandwich
😂😂😂
doze damn pointers, it's been 5 hours still am working on that program
Seriously?? U still dint get it?
and now i am thinking to just use array instead of pointers
no dude
Ya keep it simple
i tried to debug using gdb, netbeans, codeblocks, none of them work, the last time it worked was when i was using xcode, xcode is the way to go
all hail xcode
Isn't x code the apple thingy?
yeah . . . , the one thing that apple makes for developers
But isn't it only for Mac?
It's there on Linux?
it's only for mac
U hv Mac?
Oh
*hackintosh
Hackintosh
Ya tht
did you understand merge sort or quick sort coding part ?
I still dint see it...I don't think I'll attend the session...my grandfather is at the hospital...
I'll log in to discord to get the attendance points
ohk
It works ! It fuken works !
Wht string functions u used to check for spam? Actually wht string functions are there in C?
I only used strlen
there is a strcmp,strcmpi,strcpy which you can use
I didn't have to use strcpy as I am dealing with pointers I can just do char* p = username; and it would work but otherwise you use char p[15]; strcpy(p,username);
But how did u find the spam words in the mail?
I subtracted each character of spam with that of the subject of email, if the answer is not 0 then break and continue to next spam word, after I tried every spam word on the letters starting from first word of subject I move on to the next word in subject and I check every spam word from that subject word onwards, you can see the code I gave, the logic is same the problem was very small, I'll give you the fixed code.
spam mail; then first my subject_word will point to 't' (this) and spam_word will point to 's', now subtract them and increment both pointer until I reach end of spam_word. Now I move my pointer subject_word to 'i' (is) and repeat the same, as soon as I see that the difference is non zero I break and continue to next spam word
There is no direct find function?
no
you have to do everything by yourself here.
i managed to implement recursive function in bookTickets 🤣
Holy shit
Holy shit again
//hastebin.com/xadetufiyu.cpp
//hastebin.com/iwaxagemut.cpp
when you get time try to find bugs in it
Dint u finish it?
i did, just wanted another human to test it
Wait so u dint finish the entire thing
i did
* as per my testing
I'll go home and check...at grand parents house now
Hey u hv an office activator?
Can u send it to me?
I don't have it right now, am outside (java class)
Will send you once I reach home
Ok
Got Matlab R2017a for linux
Hey whts the ans for the resistance u got for this q?
What where ? Link ?
I got Rx=35
I don't have office activator, the one I have doesn't work, KMS Pico should work download it from 1337x.to
got the torrent
Not rx...after simplifying the stuff
//linuxtor.org/155-mathworks-matlab-r2017a.html
Link has magnet link
10 ohm - load
see mine
can't read, indistinguishable fonts 😐
The word is short circuited
I used a lot of Star-delta stuff
you don't have to
at all
they are in simple series and parallel
you shouldn;t be getting shorted terminals, something is wrong there
Ya
And in urs, where did the top 12 ohm and top 6 ohm go?
before star delta you didn't have shorted terminals then after star delta also you shouldnt have any shorting
Nm
parallel
30 and 6 too are in parallel
and resultant of those ^ are in series
i've never used multisim
It's Matlab
Or simulink to be exact
Ignore the scope and shit
Like in a normal circuit, where do I place the voltmeter and ammeter so that I can find the load resistance?
uhh voltmenter parallel to the load and ammeter in series with the load
So Thts rite? Wht I did
The voltage and current measurement thingy are the meters
the voltmeter should be between battery -ve terminal and 4ohm positive terminal
i'll have to learn this
the answer is close to 10 ohm
It's simplish
9.16 ohm
And wht did u use for the graph?
If u double click scope it'll show u graph
matlab and desmos
Desmos?
its an online graph plotter
Oh
you gotta teach me tomorrow simulink, i can't figure it out 😥
by tomorrow i mean on 3rd
👍🏻
have you done anything in maths assignment ?
Nope...one of the matlab ones is like comp...finding element in an array and gettinh its index
Yeah did that
I just linearly searched for element
If I sort it and then search time complexity is O(nlogn)+O(logn) but if I do linear search it's O(n)
I will have to ask sir what to use
Because linear search is too simple for an assignment
They haven’t asked for time complexity so don’t scare me...I don’t want to explain tht stuff
I’ll google some complicated algo and use it😛
They said to compare with find method
If your data is unsorted there is no other algorithm other than linear , they haven't taught us threads in MATLAB so we can't use that
Then how do u find out the time taken by ur method and the find method? Some inbuilt thing is there in Matlab?
I'll have to see that today
find is overloaded like it can find elements which are greater than the passed argument, find elements which are equal to passed argument and similar stuff, our user defined method can only search for an element
Oh
Still thts not related to math...it’s more like a comp question
check it again, i got 59^2/70^2 * 10 ; 59 muh roll number
X = RollNumber %100 and Y = 2X
Wht formula used?
i^2 R
i is same through all resistors as they are all in series (after simplifying the load)
i = source voltage / (total resistance)
Total R = 10+35+20
10+35+20 is not 70
*25
the internal resistance of the source*
In the figure 3, u add X and Y to get total voltage?
yep
Ok thanks
Wait
not going anywhere today 😌
imagine ground is your negative terminal
open the negative part of the cell and connect it to ground
Huh?
just remove the grounds for now
In the figure in the q, there are parts left hanging loose(dont now wht u call them in PCBs) so how to represent them in the diagram
ignore the hanging loose wires, just cut them
So don’t draw them in the circuit?
those traces would have been desinged to put some other component in them
nope you dont
Ok I’ll crop it off then
Thanks
👍 awesome
our time-table changed ?
Why would it change?
maybe just rumors
How do u calculate it using the Vth^2/4Rl formula? I used urs and I got a different answer
i think your Vth or Rl might be wrong
How?
U end up simplifying the circuit completely rite?
yeah
try simulating the circuit, use a potentiometer or a rheostat instead of Rx
the power is 7.1W for you
when Rx = 35
wait no
thats for me
its 12.42 wats for you
Ya I got it using urs but how do u apply thevenin's theorem?
And u hv to apply thevenin's theorem to find Rx in the first place
they didn't say to use thevenin
falstad is way better 😁
or maybe because i'm used to it
thevenin is BS , i used our normal thing, until unless they force me to use thevenin i wont use it 😂
Wait whts the ans? Like power thing is not given in the pic
P = V*i
11.14*1.11
U need to reduce the circuit to thevenin's equivalent circuit and the value of Rth u find out is the value of resistance for maximum power transfer...so u kinda need thevenin's theorem
your Vth should be 41.6989V
to get the correct answer
I'll ask sir wht to do
Finished everything in electrical apart from the essay q
All the writing work done
done ?
Yup write essay ask this doubt to sir and update all the index and stuff and electrical over
there's something weird about the power transfer question
when Rx = 0  , i get maximum power
Best is to ask sir
yeah, i realise that we generally calculate the load resistance for maximum power
Ya
if i'm not wrong then Rx = 0 we will have maximum power transferred to the load RL
what else did you finish 😦
Idk can't think anymore
Thts all...comp did the writing part of 3qs
U?
similar, i still didnt write the debate parts
U Finished everything except debates???????
😱😱😱
😵
🤣😂 , that's a long shot
no there's a lot left
Wht u finished?
nothing finished entirely
about 60% of maths,EEE,CS finished
and chemistry am doing today
what did you write in EE Lab manual ?
Tomo chem lab noe?
Chem or electrical?
tomorrow is tuesday
Yaaa I think tomorrow is electrical
Shit
I hv to write
Which experiment we should write?
the thing is we didnt do the first part of the experiment, the verification of thevenin's theorem, we directly did the power one
😓
Ignore off...write wht we did
i and shubham were thinking of simulating the circuit, add 5% tolerance and record those results
Dude that'll take time...I think
the readings table is also werid
Oh ya...the one with the wrong resistor value
write till the power thing, we can write the rest in lab
The dude gv us the wrong one
Tomo experiment is long it seems
The dude told noe
uhh, there might be more like us who didn't write their manual
Ayioo I'll wrote something...he also said it was fine so leave...In the limitations I'll write something like non availability of required resistors or something
read the 4. Experimental Procedure part, we didn't perform the experiment as the manual says
Oh ya dude how do we fill the table?
Ya best is to ask sir how to write this thing...u can't fill the table properly only
We hv three cases of values...and the table only has space for one
the experiment doesnt even say to vary the RL value
Ya
So r u writing something?
The experiment says to vary voltage
we vary the potential to change Rth such that Rth becomes equal to Rl, its actually better than removing and putting back resistor
And there's nothing about maximum power transfer theorem...theory or calculations...in the manual
Actually
???
i've written stuff about calculating Rth and Vth
But no values?
I won't write anything...I'll ask sir wht to do
i can remove my A4 sheets, they arn't stapled
Ya noe
Pakka tomo electrical lab?
pakka sure
i just cheked our previous lab date
Oi send math
what all did you write in EE part A ?
send that part
I dint write any part A's
umm, anyways you finished other stuff in electrical right ?
Ya
yeah i didnt finish some parts of the question so .
you have short procedure of copper in brass no ?
It's there on the class group
yeah got it
Dude r u going for the debug thingy?
50 so yeah
OK I'll also come then...tht interview thing is there noe?
Dude send chem and math
we need to draw the civil figures in autocad
what should we write in compare function
Wht compare function?
compare to find
I wrote how there are many uses and all
help find -
.it gives you the help file
edit find
then you can edit find
ask that civil question in discord homework help
I tried to sort a 100000000 elements array in MATLAB, and it crashed, that find function searched for element without sorting then , and still faster than my linear search
linear search took 30 seconds, sort+binary search - 173 seconds, find function- 0.3 s there is some kind of black magic going on in find
😳
hey how much did you finish ?
Not much at all😓😓😰
Today will finish Chem and send you
You finish the others
i found some stuff laying on the internet
might be useful . . .
Wait u solved it???
😆 no but the internet did it for me
Wth...
Chem and math?
yeah, the teachers were dumb, they took the questions from a book, we found that book, and also there is solution book for that book so ta-da
chem is almost done re, only one paragraph left, next 30 minutes and chem will be done
like printout ready type of done
Holy shit OK don't forget to send it
yeah sure
Thnx man
Math part b first q
*part
i found the velocity of the particle and integrated it
Velocity at what time?
Pi?
at t = pi
yep
Thts a constant
-3pi/2
yeah and integration of a constant is ?
-3xpi/2
you forgot something
How did u get the 2pi^2 part
Huh?
integration constant c
Ya that
yeah now find c, it should be 2pi^2
How did u get c=2pi^2?
-3pi/2t + c =  displacement at t = pi using the s(t) equation
I thought u used y=mx+c but I couldn't figure out how u got value of c
lim t -> pi
find the value of the piecewise function when t tends to pi
So u found displacement at time t=pi and equated it to 3xpi/2+c?
yeah and also x = pi
Ya
should i write those steps in assignment ?
Idk...wait how the hell did u get the displacement at t=pi? Did u like get the displacement at that time using the distance function in the given in the q?
yeah
you approach t from left and t from right
you have two functions
they should touch each other at t = pi, i.e. continuous
Second function is not given
you just integrated to find that function when t > pi
So u need the function to find the function is wht ur saying
😳
not really
-3pi*t/2 + c = t^2 + 5sint , now put t = pi
you will get the value of c
U mean 1/2(t^2 + 5tsint)
yeah yeah , forgot the half
...OK I got 2pi^2, but if u look at the graph, when t=pi, the distance isn't 2pi^2, it's around 4.9-5ish
its pi^2/2
So Is the graph wrong?
its correct, matlab never goes wrong
and i passed the right functions to the the plot method
No like is the equi wrong
Why is there discrepancy?
put t = pi into your equations you will get pi^2/2
Ya
Oh
Crap
Ok
Nm
Shit
Ya
😅
C is y intercept
😋 yeah thats a way to interpret lines
Dude can u send the doc file instead of pdf?
😐 but why ?
Nm...I found shortcut keys to write eqs do writing it is faster
How do u insert matrices of any size??
I needed the doc since I don't noe how to do this...converting from pdf to doc screwed up the formating and I ended up copying some matrix from somewhere and editing the values😂
There is a matrix format in equation
Ya but that's only pre-defined sizes
Like if I want 50x100 or something
Wait
OK nm
It's right
U went to college?
Yep
Can u send math?
You have PDF no ?
Ag undergoes oxidation
Ya I got it
Some stupid thing I thought
Can u send math?
Yeah, ok when I reach home will send it
Wth u haven't reached yet?
No, was teaching sanobar how to do the spam mail thing, it ended up me doing all the work
Ayioo rama
Also send the comp one...I want to noe how u wrote the references...I don't have any references!
Or can u refer sites like quora and all?
U Finished civil?
Nope, not even Wikipedia
Not yet, just reached home,
😳😳😳
It was raining heavily
U r so chill...I'll dying in the essays
Chill everything will be fine
😉
If I chuck doing the spam filter I can kind of relax...I hv civil and essays left but I really want to do spam filter
Do spam filter
It's easy
Make a very simple spam filter
That will take the spam word and compare it with every word in subject
Hell no it'll be boring
Then one option, today full night do spam filter tomorrow finish the rest
im doing ulta
you finished debate part of civil ?
nope
only comp debate over
that's it ?
Have all the essays left except comp essay...finished it just now
And full civil
oh boi, then we should finish civil today
i drew stuff with autocad
though it looks very unprofessional
Thts why use paint
And in the electrical essay...everything is there in the slides only...can we write slides in references?
nope
Dude how do u return a string in a function?
return an array of character
i would do that like char* myfunc(char* test, int test2);
just like you return an array you return a string
how much civil finished ?
Dint start
spam filter program done!
Same functionality as urs, only flaw is tht the spam words can't have spaces...they should be only one word
👍
Checked it?
How much did u finish in civil?
//hastebin.com/oqowuxutad.vbs
(
you tell first ><
I literally dint start...starting tomo morning
Technically I thought I'll copy from urs😛
Hey send math and civil
🤣 civil is under progress, autocad is very nice
How much is left for u?
though now that i have autocad+foxit+netbeans+matlab open i am having some problems
+firefox running media
my windows paging file is also filled up
That's a lot of ram usage
😪4gb
caps out pretty quickly
??
just finished 2 questions
in civil
No like overall
All assignments
overall CS and Civil is left for most part, and EEE only debate part
CIvil will finish today and CS tomorrow
Shit I have to write algo for the spam filter...😳😱😰
and today maths sir solved assignment questions
the program didn't work
He solved it?
Mine?
//hastebin.com/oqowuxutad.vbs
yep
yep, because every other maths teacher did so he had to do it too
Crap I now whts wrong
I basically check for spam stuff after the user enters mail content...since u added the spam word after entering the mail, when it checked the mail the word dint exist...
I'll change it wait
OK I can't do it without objects and classes (or structures)...I fixed the problem but I encountered one where if the same guy sends multiple mails I can't keep track of which mail is sent by which user...the arrays get messed up
So this is a limitation
yeah
and i can write limitations that that shit i forgot
i think i can ditch linked list
and still get away with working program
This is the only q where I have proper limitations
U have waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay too much time on ur hands
And I'm already sleepy
U can do it using dictionaries/mappings but objects/structures is better
i don't know mappings in C, i already have a structure just need to add a array of string into that that will store all emails of that user
then everytime i can check if that user already exists then add email to that user
Is it possible to make an array of a structure?
of course, that's what i did
array of email structures and email structure has unsername, numberOfEmails, numberOfSpamEmails and an array of string with emails
Oh good C is fine regarding that
Ohhhh
yeah but i didn't think of this before and instead i made another username list for no reason
Damn u can't do this q without structures
you can though
keep track of index values
It'll be waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay to complicated
And hard to understand
yeah, and that's why god provided us with structures as he wanted us to create our own type of data
😂
😂😂😂
Hey send civil and math when ur done
yeah yeah
it will be like at morning 3 am or something
Holy when will u sleep?
Thts fine
yeah and that's why i reached home late today
Are our ans in math right? How did he solve the rolles theorem part?
he said yo use intermediate theorem
and also he gave a matlab function to do that
i mean he gave us the algorithm but we can understand
Wth I'll use Newton raphson method👍🏻
he said you can also use that or graphical method approximation, but we only have to prove that there exists not find the value iteself
i just had this though, remember that scanf only takes one word and not the complete sentence, we can use this to store word in an array while taking input then later we don't have to separate out words
like char subject_words[50][50]; while (scanf("%s",subject_words[i]) && subject_words[i] != '\n') i++;
U can use tht
scanf("%[^\t\n]s",<var>);
Thingy
Oiii, send math and civil
I slept through 😥, just woke up
take civil
When did u sleep yesterday?
Or did u sleep today like 5 in the morning?
5 AM 😌
yeah good guess
😳😳😳😳😳😵
I'll die if I sleep then...
how much left for you ?
Thanks for the assignments
Finished chem debate...doing phy debate
Civil full left
Math debate
Comp outputs
And all the index stuff and name writing things
finally did the EE experiment
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
dammit it's 40 + X/10
Oh
It should be 45.9 for u
yeah
Only have civil and math debate left...u?
civil fully done, only EEE debate and CS little left.
Lucky...
2 debates and comp spam prog
😒 but you took 2 days leave
I'm hoping to do comp with structures but idk
Ya I write and think
how'd you draw the FBD's in civil ?
Even though u gv me ur assignments I only read them and did everything by myself
Paint.net
The first q is messy
Hey send civil debate
Thnx
It isn't urs though...or did u change everything???
nah not time, it's someone
i always write the subject code
U used this?
yeah

i took thes ^
How the hell did u get them
Like how did u noe relevant stuff was written in the books?
🙃 google books
you even get the page numbers
send me your first page of assignment
And did you start taking printouts ?
Hey for the riemann sum thing, how did u get the graph? Like all the rectangles and all
Nope
use rsums in matlab, type help rsums
how is the department computer science ?
nope that was plotted online
We are in the cs department right?
Where?
desmos
Crap
but then you have to learn how desmos works,
Ya...
use rsums in matlab, that works
or  use your paint.net
Does it give graph?
Oh ya good point
rsums is for plotting graph
OK give me a func
X^4?I'm
Is fine?
but in exam we wrote the department as electrical no
x^2
OK then don't do that and print the rest we'll ask Maam
Or sir
look in the assignment questions pdf
there department written is electrical
Then write that
Best is to follow the pdf
Dude do u have the code for the desmos thing?
In Matlab the y axis labels are not small enough
You can change the y labels the method I used in graph plot
No it gets deleted once you exit browser
I used that I got this graph
I think I need to change my MATLAB codes as people might have copied as it is
And sir told me specifically not to share my latex source
For the 1st q in part b, should we write the code for the graph? The question doesn't say to do so
No you don't have to
yeah that's what i am going to write to , well a similar one at least 😂
now you are doing CS, so others finished ?
Ya only cs pics left and index and stuff
U?
same
but i have to add some stuff to CS debate
Dude I ended up getting a seg fault in my spam prog for some reason
Nm I fixed it...luckily I sent u the code before trying to fix that problem u found out
how did you manage to get a seg fault ? did you do something like int a[5] and tried to access a[100] ?
try in windows you wont get a seg fault 😂, windows doesnt give a damn about pointers
No clue...dint check the code I just rewrote the entire thingy (Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V)
for me my program only works on linux, in windows that double pointers give errors and program doesn;t even compile
😂😂😂
I haven't installed any C stuff on windows...so Idk if it'll run on windows...I use Linux for programs
Hey did they give papers on Saturday?
nope
😓
they still have to give civil and cs
Is any C compiler there by default in windows?
😂 what do you think
Ya
But God noes if it's as easy to use in Linux
Like via cmd
you can use gcc in windows cmd or powershell
but customization capability of cmd or shell is zero
Oh wow one good thing about windows
Lol nm
😂😂
Dude do we hv proctors?
We didn't check at what frequency the current is max
GNU Octave 😂
its actually like 10000% faster than matlab and does everything that matlab does
and also it has a gui version of it, though i run it non-gui mode
Wth is tht fact function??😂😂😂
Wht happened to the whts app group?
contact rishabh bhaiyya from our group
linux gnu facts 😝
yeah he added you to group
It's not factories?😂😂😂
No
It's true facts
*factorial
U had proctor meeting?
Yeah
Wht was it?
it was us giving suggestions and complaints
i spoke about our EVS teacher
and others complained about all teachers pretty much
they even said that chandan sir teaches too high level 😝
😳😳😳they think Thts high level???
for some reason, yeah
i donno what's wrong but i tried the assignment 2 cse the code size is already beyond the size of the first assignment code
😳😳😳
U got apron?
nope
he said they will give in class
what do you make of this ^ ?
Input is the stuff the structure contains
Then an option which writes the current structure data to a file (as a structure using binary files? Idk)
Then another option which reads the full file and displays the contents of the file
Ohk then it's done
I thought I needed command line arguments
gets is harmful as there are buffer overflow attacks for it
Oh
looks like crossover works
Go to file
And see if it’s activated
Crack?
Like office crack
no crack
it will expire on 19th it says
Ayioooo
let's see what happens after 19th
Send cross over noe? Along with the crack
microsoft toolkit doesnt work as it need dotnetfx
And office u got from where?
torrent
i downloaded office 16 x64 and x86 and office 13 x64 and x86, it turns out 64 bit things dont work with wine
Ya it doesn’t
Crossover doesn’t work
Send the links where u got cross over and office nor
*noe
The same website from where I got MATLAB for Linux
Wait the link I sent?
Linuxtor or something
Office also from there?
Yeah
That from 1337x
I give up
No crack for word
i think we can manually reset the trial grace period
EEE manual 😨
I’m not coming tomo...got fever😭😭😭😭
☹ shit
i dont understand a thing when i opened the transformer short circuit test
I don't get the experiment...most probably we should do it again
🤒 yeah now even i feel sick
Lol
Tht experiment is beyond weird
We r bunking dude 😀
Wait ur bunking lab????????
😂 yeah
😳😳 how many people came?
There were like 48 but everyone is bunking now
Send your project diagrams
We are having a meeting now
What happened in the meeting?
Sir told to make phone to phone feature first then go to customer to ask for other features
The thing he told first?
yeah
👍🏻
i am getting message from phone, shubham bhaiyya will receive that data and give it to the server, then i think rishabh bhaiyya will get the data and store in server then someone else will send the data to appropriate user.
Downside is that I can't run PowerPoint and word at the same time, but that can be fixed easily in the script...I don't syntax tho
Another downside is that the virtual machine has to be in a saved state...Thts not exactly downside but ya
But definite downside is that battery will drain faster
I will stick to dual boot
4gb ram 😌
Ya I need to add more ram...and I was thinking to chuck the cd drive and put an ssd with Mac on it...it's possible rite? Will the grub show option for Mac or should I change the boot order whenever I want to log into Mac?
Another downside is that alt-tabbing becomes weird...when word is focused, it alt-tabs through all the windows stuff, when any Linux app is focused, it alt-tabs through all the Linux appd
SSD with Mac ?
It won't work
You need a special EFI bootloader like chameleon or clover
And a special modified Mac os which you should make yourself from vanilla Mac and then install that
So wait, u can't install Mac os on ssds? Only hdds??
Win 7 takes very less ram...when running word it took only 600 or so mb
You can, I use Hackintosh on SSD, on HDD it's too slow
I'm fighting with BSOD from yesterday 😐
BSOD?
Yeah
Some driver problem
Blue Screen of Death
Finally 🤣 I deleted the drivers from recovery disk command prompt
Command Prompt is Cancer
I wonder why does it even exist
There is no "grep" in cmd, you have to go "dir l more" and keep pressing enter , very annoying
Now my touchpad and keyboard both don't work , "windows logic"
And windows removed grub in the process 😌
Yo dude if we ever complete Engineering we need to make a custom Linux Operating System that supports windows software's out of box and easy to use like Zorin OS only difference will be that this will be free.
There is a light edition of windows 7 I think we can use that
I faced purple screen of death...something had happened to my display itself...once I replaced it everything was fine
Windows and mac
Mac's are on a different level 😂
I wonder if we can port office for Mac to Linux
Github username firekind
Fractal pattern dp huh?
Mandelbrot
😋 yup
invitation sent
Dude for the comp assignment second question b part, the input is just the roll numbers rite?
Name, Registration number, Address and Marks of students
Crap structure
well you can avoid it though
create a array of names, registration numbers, addresses and marks. no you store all the 0th locations of each of those arrays with data on one student and then at the 1th locations of those arrays store the second second, and so on
Hell no Thts long
I used structures 👍🏻
Understood pointers a bit more
you used pointers in that ?
Used qsort
qsort based on registration number ?
what if my registration id is 17ETCS002159, will it work ?
Reg number is int
If I change to str and make some changes in the comparator function for the q sort it'll work
ok
you tried any other assignment ?
Nope doing 3rd q of comp now
In the mailing list thing, should we take the address as an input as well?
Name, Department, Company, City and Zip Code
But a mailing list should have the address of the ppl...it's like common sense
when you know the company name, city and zip-code, that accounts for the address
In a way...but house number, which street and all u won't get to noe
they havn't mentioned that, so its like a mailing list for working professionals, as to send them a mail you only need their name and company address mostly
the debate part atleast ?
Dint even see the other assignments qs
U going for any of the events?
😆 all of them ofcourse
Ur gonna stay till 12 in the morning???
I'm only going for the python thing
you can also go for c debugging
for narcodes, yeah
😆 isn't that where you are already good at
I dunno image processing and all
Dude I'll be coming really really late today
Bugsquash was out of this world
😆 it's good that you didn't attend.
There was a question that invoked several pointer functions that returned something and also it was under recursion
😳😳😳
how many people came?
30-40
45 what say ?
For?
C in class
Ok
But ask on the group of anyone will come
attendance increased from 94 to 100 in chem, what is this shit ?
Wth lucky
") var is always a string, in python 3.2 though in 2.7 it's fine
I had to do int(var) all the time
In 2.7, input() will try to guess the data type of the thing u entered. Not sure how it works in 3
In 2.7, there's a function called raw_input() which returns string
Same function as input
But in 2.7, there's a problem in using input()...say ur program is x=input("blah blah blah")

And u execute it and u type
>>>hello
It'll give error as it can't determine the type of hello
U have to give
>>>"hello"
To make it work
huh ? then how do you take strings without quotes and without using raw_input() ?
U can't
U hv to use raw_input
Thts why input() is not that encouraged
But this problem isn't there in 3.x
And there is no raw_input in 3.x
yeah so every time i have to do int(var) in python 3
Ya
9th std kids are the problem setters for ICOP1802 which will be conducted tomorrow in codechef, these kids are certified oracle developers, dammit dude where do we stand now
😳😳😳
What ? How's that possible ?
"p"() = p() ?
What did Akash say about the single quotes ?
eval("p")()=p()
He said it's just single quotes in bash
Thts all
It's for multi line strings in bash
Try echo '
```echo '```
After today's maths class I have started to doubt is d(sinx)/dx  = cosx ? I mean there should be a error now
🤬 <- is this new ?
😂😂😂
Wht is new? There’s a q Mark
Dude, the error thing he taught was for 3vars ...partial diff will be there for that...and the error thing is just an application of the complete derivative of a function of 3 vars
d(sinx)/dx is cos x
He did dy/dx=f’(x) and cross multiplied to end up getting an eq which can be used to calculate errors
New emojis ...
He said the error happens with one variable also
Yes !
So d(sinx)=cosx.dx ?
And that means d(sinx) != ∆sinx and that is a error no ?
Hmm you know what, ∆x=dx when ∆x -> 0 that means the error nearly becomes 0,
Idk ur confusing me

You deleted this message
..
My VM runs in 512 MB ram !!
👋 windows
So u can see deleted messages still
Yes yes
Dude the question itself is mis leading
i know 😂
U should’ve written abt the risk in answering only 6qs
you make another straw poll
Idk how to
Whts a straw poll in the first place?
Ik poll but straw poll?
//www.strawpoll.me/
its just a name
Before that, how many ppl even answered the poll?
10
Lol
😌 if the CR will send the poll link everyone will vote
LOL many ppl mute the group and keep...they don’t even see the messages
🤣 you just post it.
Which version of MATLAB will work on 1gb ram?
🤔 non GUI version ?
GUI
the person for whom I’m installing has no computer sense
Then install Octave
MATLAB can't work on a gig
Octave even has a CLI mode. Like a interpreter
Windows
Not Linux
Dude create a poll and send me the link...I can’t figure out where I see the results
Hey whts the dif between a broadcast and a group on WhatsApp?
Octave has windows version too
I donno never used, try it
What should be title and options ?
Chuck it
When should we give our elec lab manuals?
anytime, i am thinking of submitting it on friday
Don’t forget to bring the external hard disk with the games tomorrow
What's games do you need ?
I’ll see
If u can get the hard disk bring it
It's not like a pocket HDD it a desktop external HDD, so it might be risky to carry it in a bag like that.
I have a pocket HDD also
Ok wht all games do u hv?
You name it, I got it
I so lazy that I would rather download it than connect my HDD and copy 😂
Aey I want to choose...I don’t have any specific game that I want...send pic of the folders of the games, the names will be on the folders I’ll see from there
on assignment submission day we can do this, as there willbe no classes and no books in my bag
Ull get the external HDD then?
yes
You deleted this message
👍🏻
Tomo we’ll sit in the front bench
😂 ya we can't sit in the last even if we want to
😂
char *string = malloc(1);
strcpy(string, "12345678912345678");
printf("%s\n", string);
for some reason the above code works ^ , i've just allocated 1 byte to *string, but it can store a string much bigger than that. power of c
change malloc(1) to malloc(0), it will still work;
😕 even if i do free(string), i can still do scanf("%d", string); it works
nevermind I found the problem
Huh???
How?????
It's just the way Malloc is implemented.
malloc(0),malloc(1).....malloc(23) all will give you 24 bytes of memory
As soon as you do malloc(24) you get 40 bytes of memory
They will teach us this in 3rd semester
Why?
//monades.roperzh.com/pony-programming-language/
I’ll install arch on virtual box...want to try out
Okay
😂 search for my video on YouTube
👍🏻
Dude u hv the qs pdf?
For math
The practice questions
only the homo one
Send wht u hv
Thnx
Try this question
Ur own question?
Why don’t u put the Hamiltonian operator in it? It’ll be much more interesting uk
The q makes no sense...is eq one and eq two part of the question or is it the answer or something?
It was given to me by pritam
U found out all the derivatives and did it...brute force approach
😐 what else will you do ?
Point
You can do it in 2 pages if you write Fx instead of writing do F / do x
Ya that
Wait wait
No, do² F / dox doy = Fxy
What did I write then?
😂😂
Hey what’s chroot environment?
And when I reboot, I end up going to the uefi shell😓😓😓
systemctl poweroff -i
And you don't have a xorg server so shutdown now won't work
chroot is used to change your root directly to somewhere else
For example when you boot from pendrive your root is your pendirve but after installing you need to arch-chroot to your HDD and installed GRUB and stuff needed to at least boot next time.
I fixed this
Ok I’ll try it wait
You somehow f'ed up xorg and now he is very angry on you
I dint do anything with Cory
Xorg
Then you have to do something with xorg
//www.tecmint.com/arch-linux-installation-and-configuration-guide/amp/
Followed instructions on this link
😂 follow my guide, not all guides work
Ur guide was scary in partitons
Be very careful with what you installation and configure, one small step wrong and things go haywire
cfdisk is nice👍🏻
Ya
I prefer fdisk all the time
It's more powerful than cfdisk
You know there is a script that does all this for you ?
search for cnchi
Or arch architect
I had dream yesterday, someone gifted me a triple monitor laptop like Project Valerie. 😂
😂😂😂😂😂
Nice dream😂😂😂😂
Nope
It's correct
Wait
It should be ln(x^3+y^3+z^3-3xyz)
And its u=ln(that thing ^)
But doh what by doh x?
How do U even do that sum?
Or is it an implicit function?
There are errors in the questions I agree
Diff of ln x is 1/x noe?
So how is doh u/doh x=1/u times 3x^2-3yz?
Ya
Missed voice call
Then urs is wrong noe?
But I proved the thing so it's correct
But urs is wrong right?
But why ?
Except the last step everything is correct
Maybe u=x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3xyz
Yes !
What did I say here M
Ya then what do I do god noes
Wait
U said u=ln(stuff)
I’m saying u=stuff
And function is ln(u)
I did it a little wrong
U definitely did something wrong
Lemme just write it again
Second last step, how did u take (x+y+z) common?
Wait
I dint get anything wth did u do?
//ncert.nic.in/ncerts/l/ieep202.pdf
now we realise ncert was good too.
Whts this ?
read the page 2 of that pdf
taking out x+y+z common is a identity
Ok but wht did u do about the times u part???
Dude wht did u do?
which step ?
dude no no no
it not squared like that
Then?
Get it ?
I got this but I hv to see how u applied it in the ans
Yaaaa
So u diff 3/(x+y+z) w.r.t x , y and z then added them? But wht happened to the square?
I'll write that step properly
Ok
3 was constant so I took it out before derivating
Ohhhh
Ok I got it
Thnx
😆 aah finally
😅
Installed arch
Three times
And guess wht was the problem with the shutdown thing was
Do u have a video on installing gnome on arch?
It just crashed for me
Installed arch again👍🏻 this is the fourth time😂
No, because it's easy to install
Ok I’ll ask u later
Can u ans this?
Ya ya I just woke up 🧐
I'm trying trying to understand why am I in this world. Will take some time
Even your Ubuntu takes so much time to boot
I'm a human 😂
Ur here to kill ur laptop by capping its RAM and swap for no reason by using a small C program
It's still alive 😉
It's a circle !
Huh?
they have given us the polar coordinates of the circle
Chuck that
its the same as x^2+y^2=r^2
Diff?
okok i will do the normal way
Ok
wait, it's easy na ?
its normal chain rule
Like whts doh z/doh x?
i dont think we can find that
z is not given to us
z is some function of x and y but we dont have that function
Ya chuck
I’m so frikkin stupid
Like idiot
I got it...it was so simple😂😂😂
So how's arch ?
Just installed it...that to on VM...so it’s slow graphically
Installing was fun tho
I’ll pakka fail tomo👍🏻
I got this
YouTube is red Facebook is blue ```sudo pacman -Syu```
It rhymes but Syu is like apt-update right?
Ya, update and upgrade
👍🏻
Install ```yaourt```
Done
then you feel the power of AUR
And ```pacaur``` also
Lol I hv to start
So during sem end I’ll remove Ubuntu from my laptop and put arch
For college work ud prefer arch or Ubuntu?
ubuntu
Reason?
ubuntu still supports most of the stuff out of the box, my kernel drivers for touchpad doesn't exist on arch, i have to recompile the whole kernel for arch, here on ubuntu i already have a kernel patch. but as soon as kernel 4.16 or later releases i am hoping the kernel supports my hardware, then i am willing to switch to arch. and also most of the guides to do stuff exist for debian, arch is used by professionals who know linux inside out and can do everything by themselves from scratch. i don;t have the time to do all that for arch now, maybe when i become a working person i will go full-on arch. but for now debian is fine. and also major softwares like matlab are more inclined to debian based systems and the packages they install are mostly debian compatible, so you might experience installation problems now and then and you end up getting a .deb package to install on arch, though there are ways to convert a .deb package to a arch installable one by using debtap though it doesn't really work well, i''ve experienced errors when trying so.
i had a lotta problems installing my printer driver on arch, because i could only find .deb drivers which then debtap spits out errors and i had to manually install them, and still it doesn't work as good. there one very good thing in arch, the Arch Wiki, you will find guides to do everything, but you have to invest time on it. whereas ubuntu, its automatic. ubuntu and arch are like windows vs linux. again it's your compatibility of what you want
ubuntu, fedora, centos and linux mint have a bigger fan base than arch. there are spins of arch like manjaro and antergos which try to address some issues arch has. you can try those.
Ok thnx for the info
👍🏻
stack smashing, 😂, smash smash smash
Wht did u do?
Whts this new way of torturing ur laptop that u found?
i tried to swap values of array index out of bounds, it doesnt give me segfault but a stack smasher
😂wht a name
Send the code noe?
//hastebin.com/labakobide.cpp
find the error and fix it ^
Logic seems wrong but where is the stack smasher?
Oh lol
When i=n-1 in the selection_sort for loop, ur sending i+1 to min function which becomes minIndex and that is returned from min function and passed to swap...but why dint u get seg fault...oh ya it doesn’t go inside the loop in the min function...😂😂😂👌🏻
If I had tried to do arr[minIndex] then pakka I would get segfault, but I was playing with addresses 😂
If u hv a string in a structure and u give it a value using scanf and all, if u want to change the value of that string u hv to use strcpy() noe?
Ya
If your string is a pointer then you can just assigned them
abs is unnecessary
I tried -2/10 is 0
-123/10=-12 noe?
Ya
That time -12<10
so what ?
Base case is met before num of digits is 1
So u need abs
My base case was number == 0 then return 0
Ya that also will work
```#include <stdio.h>

int count(int n) {
if (n==0) return 0;
return 1 + count(n/10);
}

int main()
{
int a=-123;
printf("%d\n", count(a));
return 0;
}
```
Ya urs it’s fine
Mine needs abs
Congrats man👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
This won’t work if the input is 0
0 is one digit long
And 000 is three digit long right ?
No but 0 is 1 digit long...u write 0 on paper and it’s one digit right? Length of “0” is 1 noe?
Hmm leave she won't notice
Should have been first 😭, I guess 2nd is not bad too
Even in our normal loop program that we did in practical 0 will have 0 digits
Arham solved the 5th one too 😱
...
0 cannot hv zero digits...zero digits means it’s not a number but 0 is a number
In total we both solved 4 each, but time was a factor.
Dude there’s waaay too much stuff for 25 marks in chem
6-7 cells, 6/7 metallurgy stuff + corrosion + fuels
I know I know, we are gonna die again
Oh and 2 fuel cells
😓😓😓😓
And which slide is overpotential in?
Is it there for test?
Larger cathode can take accept electrons easily
Electrolysis
Maybe not
I thought that when anode large and cathode small, anode acts as a sacrificial electrode and protects the cathode(the metal to be protected)
I know, but chemistry can explain everything, even if it's wrong they have a way, they call it exceptions 🤣
Lol very true
Galvanization bruh, it makes a large anode, preventing corrosion of metal
Makes sense
Ya Thts how I got it
While calculating NCV, it’s GCV-(0.09xH%xlatent heat of steam)
So if H% is 5
Then is it 0.09x5 or 0.09x(5/100)?
No no don't divide by 100
Ok?
Ok.
Ok
Ok
Dude if they give the weight in Newtons then there is no need to multiply it with g noe?
Ya no need
👍🏻
I hate myself
I’m losing 5 marks
🎉🎊
😒😒😒
😆 where did you loose ?
The 3rd q
I got wrong answer somehow
I got 40 something and 70 something
It was 50 and 80 something
Answer is 50 and 80 something
Ya
Jinx 😂
😂
😭
U get 25?
As of now maybe
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Send Sirisha'a EEE notes
Ok it’s decided...I’ll put arch on my laptop...I’ll give it around 70 Gn
*gb
Right after windows defragments C drive
Which will take god noes how long
So I’ll triple boot my pc? Or tri boot?
Wait a sec...how do I do this?
Like I already hv grub...so how do I make grub noe that arch is there on the pc so please display it on the grub menu?
After you install arch just do os-prober it will add arch to grub
Do I need to run the grub-install command?
Nope
👍🏻
Im using gparted to free space in my disk
Which is easy to use
Once thts done everything  else is same as the virtual box thing
And less scary
Ya gparted is easy
Finished electrical?
studying . . .
and you  ?
I’ll do motor sums tomo morn
Everything else done
I’m just studying from slides
Which Shubham sent on group
And notes I took
you studied the derivations also ?
😳😳😳
Wht derivations?
a. Explain the working principle of DC motor
b. Classify DC generators according to the manner in which field winding is excited
coefficient of coupling, dot rule, etc .
They aren’t derivations
Ik pictures😂
Derive the equivalent inductance expressions for the coupled inductors with the following connections
I. Series opposing
II. Parallel aiding
So u want to give me a heart attack and send me to the hospital
they might not as
*ask
but it's in slides
Ya...25 marks q
WTH is j tho?
In the derivations
we had asked that to sir, i forgot what he replied
Same
leave they wont ask so difficult
even i am going to solve those slides and read some definitions
👍🏻
Windows takes too long to defrag
😂 that's why NTFS sucks, EXT4, LVM3 don't require defrag
Sighhh
I dint want to lose data and it’s taking too long
The stupid thing finished now😂😂
For gparted, I need to download the live version iso and paste it into a usb noe? I don’t need to use rufus rite?
Huh, why not use gparted that's there in Ubuntu ?
Damn ya I can do that
But it would be safer to not boot into anything and then partition the disk
Better to be safe than sorry
Moreover since I don’t hv an external hdd
Oh ok then do that
Use Rufus
Theoretically it should work if you just copy paste
Ya it should
I’ll try it tomo
//www.newsbytesapp.com/timeline/Science/12691/66110/ios-11-bug-warns-iphone-users-not-to-close-whatsapp
Here's some good news for you
I do get that pop up, but even when I close WhatsApp I get notifications
The problem I had before was fixed in a WhatsApp update
Guess which shirt I’m wearing 🤣🤣🤣
The heaviest one 😂
Full marks👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
That is weird
Using wired connection ?
Type ```ls pci```
Or maybe it's ```lspci```
I think it's your WiFi driver panicking
Or your graphics card
If it's this, you are in trouble.
If it's this you need to fix it ASAP
It’s this
I was looking into how to fix it when the laptop died
How do I use AUR? Like want to install the numix-circle-icon-theme and I found an AUR page
So how do I use it?
And how do u add repositories in arch?
pacman .conf file
add your repo here ^
yaourt mix
yaourt numix
yaourt will do all the work
Format?
yaourt <package name>
and the package name need not be exact
unlike in apt where you need to give exact name
you can even do yaourt chrome
it will search string chrome packages and display you a list
No no In the Pacman.conf file, whts the way u hv to write the repo?
Wow thts useful
its like
[your reponame]
repo url
Ok
search the Arch Wiki, they tell you everything
it could be an advantage or disadvantage, AUR packages are always built from source.
its like doing sudo make, sudo make install after cloning the github repo
Woah ok
I’ll learn slowly
you dont have to do that
yaourt does it automatically for you
No no
I’ll learn how to use arch slowly
oh ok
i've had enough of arch already 😆
i'm starting to like debian
I’ll do arch first
Since it’s lightweight
And it’s fast compared to Ubuntu
I mean fast
Like really fast
Why can’t Ubuntu be like that...😭
😝 even moon has dark spots
True
and nothing in this world is idea
*ideal
Ya and for some reason we learn ideal stuff
i thought engineering would be non-ideal stuff, they already filled our minds with ideality right from the start, and then we slowly realise it was all a lie
Ikr...it’s like our life was a lie till now
Stupid ideal gas eq
😂 that's one thing

I'm gonna get f'ed in CS assignment, I used dynamically allocated pointers, so I can't write them to a file, because I can't determine the size of the pointer memory 🤦‍♂, now I have to use Google's protobuf technique to write it to file. Shit now Ami will surely go mad over me. Protobuf is a GitHub repo, and has thousands of lines of code.
Every time I try to make things simple the universe makes it difficult for me.
Don’t u need the size while using calloc/malloc? Like as an argument...just keep track of it noe??
You deleted this message
It still won't work
Because when I write a pointer to a file in actually writing the address
So if I close my program and try opening the data in file I get segmentation faults
I actually have structure pointer to data pointers
And I would have to make my own method that would keep track of size of the pointers which is already difficult and also a method to write my user defined structure to file
Remember malloc(0) gives 24 bytes ? I can't predict the size allocated to me by malloc or calloc they do some kind of data padding .
So ur saying it only writes the pointer to the file and not the whole structure/array/whatever?
And since when u close the program and open the file, the pointer points to something that doesn’t exist anymore, which gives a seg fault right?
yes exactly
there's the concept known as serialization, which we learnt in java, i never knew it would be so difficult in C, you know in java everything is a pointer, so anything that is to be stored in a file needs to be serialized.
and java has this crazy jvm that doesn everything for you. in c nope, do it yourself.
guess what, even that github code doesnt link my data, i have to do it manually, using a concept known as "pointer swizzling" who names it "swizzling"
there's no more c in year 2 right ? i'm permanently moving to java+python.
😂😂😂
If we use normal arrays it’ll work?
(
Oh good
Use normal arrays then
😒 no fun in doing that
😂😂
Figured out why my battery drains even when pc is off
I think arch enabled wake-on lan, which basically lets someone switch on a pc if it’s connected to a network
So that features runs even when the pc is shutdown, and drains the battery
and we still have to implement quick sort function ourselves
what did you do for that ?
Turns out stuff was off
So idk
248 lines of code and counting, 😪
You are gonna get us screwed, where's our script ?
Dude there’s a puja at my house
It’s almost over so wait
shubham can do it, its ok, you send us the narrator's part
Ok
Sorry about this
Got WiFi running on arch👍🏻
And icons
Tilix is taking some time...one of the dependencies (gtkd) is taking forever to install
Hey for PowerTOP In Ubuntu we do
pm-powersave true
Whts the equivalent in arch?
hmm, no idea about that.
//hastebin.com/onutiyaret.cpp
In my Ubuntu, when I launch terminal it opens tilix...how did u do that?
Did u edit something
?
yah
i deleted your gnome-terminal
sudo rm /usr/bin/gnome-terminal
and sudo cp /usr/bin/tilix /usr/bin/gnome-terminal
justin maller
lookup him ^
Managed to fix/suppress the PCIe bus error thing
Edited the /boot/grub/grub.cfg manually
In Ubuntu
Somehow found out where they add the cmd line args
it's right next to the vmlinuz thing
Which idiot had a such a naming sense? WTH does vmlinuz even mean?
its Virtual Memory LINUx gZip, a compressed kernel executable, no idea why they need it to be compressed though
read your dmesg from 13.461320
The narration part
Nice 👍 anyways it's just 3 mins.
*5
👍 got it.
have you written this in kannada-english too ?
Shubham also sent one script
That he wrote
What should I read ?
Kannada Hindi
Shit, it's too difficult for me to read
Learn Shubham’s
Okeh
You read his too ?
No I’ll probably read my moms
I can’t understand his😂
i doubt if anyone else prepared
Learn just in case
Shubham trans should be easy
Take print out and keep...u can read it also it’s fine
Hey I’ll need ur help with zsh and powerline in arch
Yeah sure
I’ll be coming late...still stuck at tin factory
Okay
I will ask Nimmi to mark you absent
Don't worry
It’s not nimmis class it’s Chandan’s
Today's Monday
Right ?
And I’ll kick u if u do that
He said he might take
_might_
Hopefully not
Text me which teacher will come
Ok
If I don't text then it's Chandan sir
👍🏻
What is our Room Number ?
What room number?
Our class
C504
Why r u asking?
Btw I’ll end up skipping math
Dying in traffic
And I hv to come by metro
Why do u ppl talk and suddenly turn to me and start laughing?
Ask sejal
Oi u tell
She won’t
Ask naa
I asked she dint
Msg her na thn
That only I did
Just forget it, it was nothing
Do you have my calc ?
Nope
You only have my calc
😒 you missed Ami's class
I have my calc and only one calc...wait I’ll check
I don’t have it
Lol what she taught?
Treeeeeeeeeeeees
Did she teach properly?
Yesssssssss
You missed it
She was amazing today
Chuck it I’ll learn later...I’m dying in assignments
Did u finish the part b q1 and the car walla? I want to cross check my answer tomo
No not yet
Ok I’ll send u the assignment and u send me one
By afternoon I’ll be able to finish typing the last one of math also
Dude do u hv the electrical readings?
Ya
Can u send? I want to give my elec lab manual tomo
you are not coming on saturday then ?
I can’t...I won’t finish assignments then
okk
btw today ami showed assignments
see shubham's status 😂
Full?
Thanks bro
22 was max
Ami actually liked my codr
She wants me to make more complex code for this assignment 🤣
Which u have done
Btw assignments help 🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
😂 bro bro even  I'm asking help to people
I’ll help👍🏻
I'm trying to do maths today
So tomorrow I can show it to sir.
Which qs?
Allll
Hey for the newton Ralph son q, wht do u mean by explain steps involved in the algorithm
Like just explain the algo
Matlab code?
The algo
Not the code
Like what even is Newton raphson
Oh
So not the codes algo?
Ask sir tomorrow
Ok
Dude did u get the graph for the newton Ralph’s on? I’m getting error
And when I correct it I get a weird graph
it won't work, you need polar coordinated, or use contour plot
What do u mean it won’t work?
And why the hell a contour plot for one variable graph?
That's what sir said
So u got it?
You finished your CS manual ?
Today will do.
I’m not giving tomo
I’ll give it later
Then when ?
Next week
And why will she accept it later ?
Wed
Idk
I’ll see
Did u do elec assignment?
I plan to do that on Sunday
Any q
And civil too
Then business?
For Business please persuade Sejal to do
🙏🙏
Lol do u think she’ll listen?
I have no idea about business
Shes in our group anyways
I’ll try don’t expect anything
we are doomed then
Did u atleast do the elec qs?
Dude which comp lab should we give?
Nope
I don't remember
Just check your date modified
It was lab 7
The structures and dynamic memory allocation walla
oh ok, i will do that later then
Sejal says “on process”
😭 does that mean a no ?
Idk
I had got answer [180,110,105,105] in that Markov
😳😳
What happened ?
What did you get
I sent see
The equation with ^ n and all gives my answer
I used the columns-adding-to-one walla like the MIT video
btw the lease is for 2 years
so you need A^1, A^2, A^3 for 2 year, 4 year and 6 year
Dude they’re asking after so many years
So why 1,2 and 3 power?
A gives for 2 years
because you have to rent a car for a minimum of 2 years
you cant rent a car for just one year
They’ve given that n is in terms of years
In the start of the q
you know that's why you dont miss university
Huh?
😂 sir told us how to do it
you were absent
...
So pakka n=1,2,3?
you do what you want
😂
tomorrow ask sir
Oi tell
you think
a little
Oh
Ya
😂 you don't say
The system changes state once every 2 yrs
ta-da
Since lease is for 2 yrs
Crap
Thanks
👍 np
that's one good thing you get when you share assignments
well that's the only one i can think of ^
Ya ull noe when ur wrong
It works best if one doesn’t do assignments last minute tho
😕 ya ya.
you took off today -_-
For doing assignment...which only happened in the morning...I watched anime in the afternoon😝😰😵
😮
Anyways tomo during lunch I’ll need help in doing elec...I dint understand some qs
You deleted this message
Huh?
Ubuntu 18.04, they made it look nice
It kinda looks the same...it looks like ur desktop
Icons r nice
Nice status dude...grouse thoughts r nice
Is it already released? Or beta?
Just check whether the answer for the second electrical question which Shubham gave from his pendrive is rite or not?
What's joules law of heating
i^2Rt no ?
Heat loss = That
Ya
Energy != Power
Ya I’m calculating energy only
Basically one is i^2Rt and the other is IVT
Vit=i^2Rt=V^2t/R
5.3k something
For IV thing ans: 5.4k
There's no way you would get different answers
That's because of precision problem.
They are exactly same formulas
Because you use V=iR get the other two formulas
No actual answer is 53xx.xxxx KW and 54xx.xxxx KW that’s a lot of error
Wait I’ll send the ans after sometime
Having lunch now
Send your EEE assignment 🤣
Actually Samhita hv me the IVT method
Ya after lunch
Dude wht do u mean by secondary power factor and primary power factor
And while finding secondary current, should we use kW or kVA?
kW=pf*kVA
so?
kW and KVA means the same
Hell no
VA = W
kVA is apparent power
kW is real power
Google it
Power = Watt
No check
Then it's just dumb to keep the naming system that way
BTW your maths Assignment has another problem
Crap now what?
I only did two questions...
lemme confirm that and tell you later.
Confirm what? Math assignment problem or kVA thingy?
maths
I didn't start electrical yet
Ok
Any progress on assignments?
Btw in the Chem
Assignment obtained from Shubham, the rate law is wrong...”he” forgot to take into account the stoichiometric coefficients
The coefficients should be divided rite?
Or multiplied?
Rate law like d[a]/dt ?
It's correct 😒
Coefficient of I is 3
In the balanced eq
Then for what do we need to divide the coefficient?
For something we should do the division thing
That's when you do 1/a d[A]/dt + 1/b d[B]/dt thing
So for diff rate eq and not the r= normal eq
And did u figure out what secondary power factor and all meant?
Nah I'm doing maths now
Send link for complex analysissss
I can’t find it on the net
it's not on ubc
Search the question, copy paste
I did...dint find it
That too I dint attend those classes😰😓😓
He didn't teach us I think
Or maybe I didn't note it down
No i dint attend full complex analysis
Ohhh
Today he did more on that
Complex analysis
Send link pls🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
552.s13.hw9.soln.pdf
Search that
Yes
Crap im not understanding shit...
Yes
That's not how you solve it
You use Cauchy Riemann equations
Wait pdf is wrong?
😳😳
Ok can u send me only that question when u finish math?
Ya ya
Is that a yes or a no?
Yes
Thanks a lot🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
Can u plot complex functions in MATLAB?
He didn't teach it
Something to do with contour
Search that while I finish Newton
Ok
And u said something was wrong with my math assignment...what was wrong?
Didn't see yet
In that Markov
Read Markov again
It’s right only noe?? Forget theory shit I wrote but answers were rite only
The lease thing I corrected
I found A^1, A^2 and A^3
Instead of 2,4,6 powers
I don’t remember if I even wrote any theory shit😂
A(k+1)=A(k)*P
See what you wrote
Ohhh
That
I chucked it and I wrote the eq which the MIT guy said
He used this and got A^n*p nought
The first video we saw
I'll check laters
The young dude not the old guy
K
Ya he's right
Ya I used this
P(k+1)=AP(k)
Okkk
Then it's right
👍🏻
Is your Markov chain dependent over the states ?
Like does the next probability depend on the previous one ?
And wait
x(n+1)=Ax(n)
n=1,2,3
And you did different
You deleted this message
You deleted this message
Ayioooooo
X1=Ax0
And x2=Ax1
Substitute 1st in 2nd
X2=A*A*X0=A^2x0
X3=Ax2
Substitute the newly formed equation in x3=blah
X3=A*A^2*x0
=A^3 x0

Therefore, we observe that X(n+1)=Ax(n) can be written as xn=A^n*x0

To find A^n, use the eigenvalues and eigenvectors thingy
U finished math?
Not yet
Hey one more doubt
In civil
How do u do the last one? U get some very very big answer
I didn't do that yet
I'm waiting for shibham
I will finish maths and we will exchange
U still dint finish math?
Nah, SVD is remaining
Everything else? Other subjects
Not started
Lol ya rite
And another doubt
The secondary power factor thingy
In elec last question
same, waiting for shubham
I got some solution but it doesn’t make sense...wait I’ll send
That's not you
Ya it’s not mine...g section someone
No idea
Hey send math once ur done
I finished one debate
Look at maths 😂
You do business and I give you maths
Let's just copy this, no other choice I can't go and read how it works, I barely understood transformers
😥 and then that civil last questions is headache
bro you slept too early 😒
Send mathhhh
I’ll be doing business in the evening
Dude send math...please
The complex analysis q
Complex Analysis by Zill, chapter 3
you did electrical last question ?
Dude I don’t have time to sit and learn complex analysis...just send me pictures of that answer that’s fine
It's the exact same question in the book
Wait
pg 164
😐
Thank me later 😒
Just go and see
Sheesh tell that when u send the pdf
And how do u plot the level curves in MATLAB?
5;
[X,Y]=meshgrid(x);
Z=X.^2-Y.^2;
contour(X,Y,Z)
Ok
Thts it???
I’ll ask you doubt tomo about the u(x,y) thingy
yeah
Thanks👍🏻👍🏻🎊
And ya I did it according to that pic which I sent
and civil last 2 questions ?
Centre of mass/gravity did yesterday....inertia walla got some very very very big answer so I dint do it
Shubham sent his so I’ll see from that
ya i got that
//drive.google.com/file/d/1y4Rq9N3eUOaGMjo9IBm_50x7vBdhOgfz/view?usp=sharing , just a warning, this time i wrote way way way more complex maths, even more than cs.
how's it ?
my mandelbrot came into my assignment
lel
sir will have fun correcting it
😂
send your civil COM waala question
and electrical last question + debate
send fast
I finished SVD I wrote some random stuff
👍 okeh
Oh ya what happened to business? I forgot
I'm gonna finish civil and electrical and then chemistry, after that only I can think of business
Electrical is done btw
How much u have left?
Civil I have left last two and debate
Electical debate is left
CS need screenshots
Btw a bit of warning, pritams Chem debate first part is not right at all...it’s very vague
Chem I have to fix he debate
Yeah
Thts alll😵😵😵😵😵
I donno how Sheetal mam approved his debate
Wow ull finish of nicely
😕 no bro
😂😂😂
I would have finished  early
But you know FML
Fml?
There's Sanobar FML
WhTs fml?
I can only think of cvs
And then there's sachin, rounak, taha, yatish
*fbd
fuck my life
Huh?
Oh
😆
Atb👍🏻
I've stopped answering calls
Samhita said that her mom is doing business for her, and when she’s done she’ll send it to me...I’ll send it to u after I get it
😱
Ya my phones on do not disturb since Friday
Mom doing Assignments 👍 lol
😆 my mom will do it in hindi only
I asked my mom also...she has done stuff on communication and all before so she noes stuff...but she lectured me telling me I should do my assignments😓😓😓
😂 Samhitha is lucky then
Bro I requested access
For the math one which u sent
Yeah , done
Ya u definitely are jobless
How's my maths
Lol
😂 very jobless
And I wrote “using MATLAB” everywhere for the SVD example
Like using eig() and all
Send the business ASA she gives you, we also need to edit na
Holy shit that’s so frikkin true😂😂😂
Hey for the electrical third question, what’s the energy wasted u got?
I copied yours 😑
Is it wrong ?
Well I did ask u that q
Because Samhitas dad wrote something else
shit, copy that then
No
Why ?
Samhitha's brothers CET rank was 68 😒, pretty sure his dad is right
Cuz joules law of heat states that the amount of energy lost while transmitting blah blah blah = I^2 r t
Yeah true
Then where do u use i^2 r t?
Look whatever you did is right
Let's stick with that
Ok
👍🏻
How much left?
Fuck there's power outage from 11 AM, laptop just died
I'm cursing my life now
In the process of getting depressed
Woah talk about really bad luck
Yeah pretty bad
How much left anyway? A lot??
Like civil debate, last question, chem debate and last question and CS screenshots
Business toh I am copying
From whom????
You 😑
Oh...ya I’ll send
Ya ya
You better do 😭😭 I'm dying
Ppt tho u should change stuff
Ok ok I’m writing it now chill I’ll finish
chill it seems 😒
😑 in not chilling
Until power comes back
Dude your civil COM has a lotta mistakes
For COM of triangles check again
Calculatation mistakes?
Nope logic problem
Just check you will. Get to know
I dint take the symmetric axis thing
Dude what’s wrong just tell
Check for A7.1 and A7.2
I'm gonna sleep now
It takes forever to go through that W
No use of me now 😭
Q
Ok Gn then
😴 ya
Dude instead of sleeping u can draw that poster and keep...and scan it and put it in the assignment once ur son
*done
What the topic of poster ?
U before learning communication skills and u after learning communication skills
Lol I’m advertising deb club of our school indirectly😂
Did you get business ?
And don’t copy the poster
It's done fully ?
Is it yours?
Ya
Dude the last q in math...how did u get ur graph like that????
😁
That's a tiny little secret
😋
I consulted some people
In Discord
I learnt a few things
In MATLAB
😋 and Ta-Da
😒😒 tell noe
I don't remember honestly
I did some stuff and I got
Can u send the picture of the graph?
😭 I'm stuck doing CSE outputs
I'm not getting the correct output
Something messed up Linux and can't access
I'm working on fixing my old code that I had saved in windows
😭 talking about luck dammit
Damn
Dude the civil first q...is mine rite?
I doubt any of my civil answers are rite
Check if u have fine
*time
Otherwise leave
And the moment of inertia q, my answer came in crores...screw it im sleeping
I think your last part of B1 has a problem
You should get 8000N
Yeah same
Only our number of digits match, me you and Shubham
😂😂😂😂
The business that you sent me is fully done ?
Was the way I found the coefficient of friction right?
Yeah
Ya I did the whole thing myself
Your mu was correct
Oh good
Even pics of slides r there
Okk
So you finalized all your assignments ?
And tomorrow last time for submission is ?
Nope comp left...I’ll do tomo morn
I think 3
Okk I hope I finish it
Ur not coming tomo?
I might not finish it early so as to come
I will come at 2 pm
Probably
Oh ok
😑 yeah I want to loose 50*7 marks right
😂
How was my maths after reading 😋
...jobless person
😂 my Mandelbrot came in you know
Ur current situation is due to u overdoing math assignment and horrible luck
😥 yeah
did you just copy your business Assignment from someone ?
Nope
Technically from the slides
Wrote everything yourself ?
Yup
😒
Asked my mom for tips and all
Did u sleep?
Nah
😳😳😳
Though I finished everything except this BS business
Business won’t take long
I did it about 3 hrs...poster ppt everything
But I have to go take printouts and stuff
I'm sleeping now
For 2 hours atleast
Shubham hasn't slept for 48 hours 😂
I actually slept in the evening for 3 hours maybe, when. I had that power outage
By 10 am I should be able to finish it and get printouts I think
Hopefully
I had just gotten up when u texted me this
I slept at around 11
...
Is he alive??
Uhh
He didn't reply further 😂
Ok he got up
He's alive 😂
Come to Uni fast
Mine everything done
Where r u?
Btw the guy getting electrocuted wasn’t in shawshank redemption, it was in the movie, the green mile
ohk
Huh?
Dude do we even have a debug session today? There’s nothing posted on the group
Nope
Next Friday
And this Saturday
Yep
There's a series expansion for pi apparently
Like Taylor
But tomo it’s sports day
Discord tomorrow
Oh
😐 get dose t-shirt for sports day
And call Sanobar
as soon as you see this message
😂
Ya I told her
U actually went?👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
😐 no she called me to tell you that you need to arrange the tshirts
😂 I would rather watch hitman's bodyguard
Even g section dint get t-shirts...they don’t even noe about it
Dude that star delta thing, how do u connect the terminals on the machine thingy?
Like there r a lot of terminals...how do u connect them?
Ok not delta
Star
Uhh you connect then so as to make a star shape
The two terminals of the resistor is given to you
Connect the two terminals on paper then on practical
No in Tht stupid machine with all the knobs and all
Yeah those nobs are the three-two pair terminals of the resistors
I'll tell you tomorrow chill
And the wattmeter should be one-one or one-two?
injective
😏
if you know what I meant
Ya I forgot wht injective functions r, u mean one-one?
Yeah
And where do we use upf wattmeter and the one-one walla wattmeter?
anyways the configuration will be written on the wattmeter
Like there r two kinds of wattmeter noe?
upf in the transformer thing
As it has a different power factor for
Upf has no one-one thing right?
uhh i think it does
One has power factor one doesn’t
In the star delta both were same wattmeters
So upf=one-one wattmeter
We can get away with using only one type of wattmeter
?
Where do we use the normal one?
We use the upf when the load is non-pure-resistive
Transformers we used the one-one walla for both tests
Wait I’m confused
What’s upf?
Upf is normal one noe,
*?
upf = cosø=1 I think the other one has cosø=0.6
but it will be written on the meter
So why care
So upf and the one-one wattmeters r different
Wait a sec...we only measure power using the normal wattmeter in max power transfer
Everywhere else we use Tht other one
😂 whatever
Ask Sejal 😂 she might know
Both are dumb 🤦‍♂
I thought they knew
😂😂
🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ Shubham toh has lost his marbles
😂😂😂
Dude whts the formula for slip in induction motor experiment?
Ns-N/Ns
Ns is rated speed
N is the speed which we measurr
Ok whts the rated speed of the motor?
1500rpm
Aey ur dp is normal
🤷‍♂ for a change
Ya who r u and what did u do to Satyajit?
😂 he's dead
Dude I asked Arvind for feedback and he said to meet him near the canteen during short break...do u also want to meet him?
Ya ok
Oi ask Aditya if he’s coming for that quiz...I asked Farhat Maam if we can register tomo but she said we should do it today it self
Yeah yeah
He and another guy Ashutosh Dixit
You register everyone of us.
😒
Yes
Yes for what?
You will register for us
Lazy person
Yes
😒😒😒
Yes for lazy
Ik
😂
Then go and do it.
Turns out as have EVS exam on that day
We can talk about that tomorrow in the meeting
And she hasn’t replied when I said that we hv Evs exam on that day
She read the message but not replied
Dude and ask Chirag or someone about the innovation challenge
No one is answering on the CR group 😒😒😒
Yeah will ask later, I'm sleeping now
Aey ask Shubham or someone whether we should register for the quiz or what...that Farhat Maam isn’t replying only
The team sub leader Shubham
ping me when you wake up or something
Wht pattern is this? Ur dp?
part of the mandelbrot
Wth...
zoom zoom zoom and ta-da
aka julia-set
Dude see thinmatrix’s channel
His tutorials for learning, and from the game he’s making, maybe we can get some ideas
yeah
Dude who to choose as third member?
dekh bhai acche se dekhkar choose karna
Huh?
choose wisely
in short
Oi compare the list with the leaderboard and see if anyone’s there
aryan ☹
Who’s babya deep?
i don't know
Chuck third member
Keep only 2
3rd one would be helpful
Ya but we r deciding based on marks...which is not a good thing
then whats the factor
Ppl who noe stuff?
hmmm, you know someone
?
Nope
your friends in G section ?
Lol only Aryan noes something
If u compare the leaderboard and the marks thing, only his name comes up huh?
yeah
So in the end, him only huh?
i mean i dont know
is there someone else ?
Idk anyone else...
So wht to do?
i want someone else also 😭
Then chuck...no ones coming to mind
dude take in Aryan
no other choice.
He said yes
Now registration
Is it online or we hv to go to college?
college
tomorrow we are anyways coming
30
ok I'll be there.
I think you need a printout of the form
Fee is 1000 per person?
1000 as a whole.
Oh
Then how do we pay? 333 per person?
333.33333 yup
I’ll get 1000 u guys pay me later
Okay np.
Should Aryan also come for registration ?
Not necessarily
When u download and install unity, create an account or whatever(it’ll ask u to when u run it) and I’ll send a link for the project...there’s some “collaboration” thingy which lets multiple ppl (free version = max 3 ppl) to work on a project and upload the changes to cloud
Awesome !
That's lucky
Did u download already?
Ikr
No, not yet.
Who’s prabhakar sir and is siraj rival some YouTube guy?
First one I donno, second one yes.
Dude can u send pics of all the complex analysis notes sir did? Including the questions, so like everything, from beginning of complex to conformal maps
conformal maps arnt coming
Ok I will, a little later.
Ya till conformal
Like conformal not included
Open interval
too lazy to search for my book
Theres time for maths, chill
Ya ull mostly go off WhatsApp when exams r near, so I told u now only when ur free
I won't.
I'll just ignore some people
Ok
Holy shit! A really normal dp😱😱😱😱
😂 ya
Ya I got the mail
Damn so true😂😂😂😂
🤷‍♂ yeah
We are definitely going right ?
Yup
Got her bag ?
Ya
1.2k wtf...
When’s the AI thing and AR thing?
Anyways if we are going we will attend all of the events
I won’t be there from 20th onwards 😓😓😓😓
Going to kovalam
🤦‍♂ ohoo
so I will have to go with aryan
😂😂😂
AR is on 19th
Apart from ethical hacking, everything else is on 20th and 21st😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
😅 your bad luck
Hey I'm buying a new lappy
i7 at least this time, with 8gigs ram and GTX 1050ti
Acer Predator Helios 300
or I have a option to get like an ultrabook
With very thin bezels
but only a Nvidia 940MX
How much does it cost?
Ultra books hv dedicated graphics???
79k
Ya but not that good at all. I think your lappy also has a MX type card.
Ya it does
It’ll be heavy most likely
Mine has 940M
Ya that's what's holding me back
Though it would be a totally worth upgrade
and I think it also has a 1080P IPS display
And IPS displays are just so much gorgeous
//www.flipkart.com/dell-inspiron-core-i7-7th-gen-8-gb-1-tb-hdd-windows-10-home-4-gb-graphics-7567-gaming-laptop/p/itmexhuhaqz5avpg
Very hard to trust when they misspell powerful 😂😂😂
🤣 yeah that's what happens when you try to say something bad about Linux
Now who’s studying
And whts with the dp😂😂😂😂
Mr. Gauss is I'm watching a movie
😂 nothing
Dude send pics of all the complex analysis notes sir did Including the questions, so like everything, from beginning of complex to conformal maps
Does this mean that you completed everything else and only complex analysis remains ?
Hell frikkin no...I’m starting math today
I think my boot time is faster with LightDM
so does that mean you completed other subjects 🤨😂😂😂😂
Nope
Yest I spent full day on the LightDM, splash screen, gdm stuff
uh huh
😒😒
QP, QP, QP 😐
I asked the pic is not mine
U think I’ll use windows???
uhh I know this not yours, your windows looks different
Yup
Who uses Windows Movie Maker lol
😂😂
someone from G section ?
And word 2007 👍
Yup
Ikr wth
Dude in the pics u sent...where does it start from? Like which is pg 1?
Uhh 😂😂😂 shit
1.
So it’s backwards?
Yep
Wht intro to complex numbers?
There’s only CR eq and Tht Milne Thompson method in complex analysis noe? Or did he teach anything else?
No that's it
And Laplace equation
Huh...I thought there was more
Dude...pics aren’t in order😓😓😓
take e^x common
This?
they skipped a step e^itheta*f'(z) = stuff so f'(z)=e^-itheta*stuff
Why e^itheta*f’(z) in the first place?
hmmm how do you derive the polar form CR equations ?
No clue
I'll write it and send it a little later.
Thnx
There isn't much in this
quite a simple derivation
Thnx
One more doubt...how do u integrate (1+e^-x)/x?
uhhh there's gamma function involved
it can't be integrated normally
integral e^-x/x is a special integral
its antiderivative is not a elementary function
just like e^-x^2 and sin(x)/x
integral sinx/x is written as Si(x) and integral e^-x/x is written as E1(x)
This was a q given by sir in class
Ya I got Tht...just need k
How do u get k?
at x=a y=b
So just substitute
They’ve given length of the curve and x not y and x
Btw check ur eq...from where x^2 came in the integration? It’s CG not MI
Oh
I thought MI
That's a typo
Oh then fine
Someone’s forgetting about the amount of work we hv after exams...codechef it seems
☹ but there's 2 days time
tomorrow i'm going out
after 9th we'll start our stuff
😒 meanwhile i learnt c++ vectors and stuff due to codechef
BTW we have to use c++
seeing this
Ya ik
Take it as reference...we’ll hv to program in whtever language we can
No ctrl c and ctrl v
Like for concept and Lagos
*algos
i vote for c++, just realised how fast c++ is compared to any other language
Depends on wht engine we’ll end up using
java my program took 1.84s, c++ same thing 0.4s
oh ya.
Yup
i guess the AI part can be any other language, not necessarily the language our engine uses.
Idk...how do u run other language code from another languages compiler?
not like that, the game data will be accessed by our engine, but we can modify that data by reading that file in c++ also right.
so both the engine and the AI use the same file
The dude uses lua or something in the book
it looked like c++ though
Ya like that
No he talks about lua scripting also...I saw in the index
we could use R if we want since we can get a lot of guides for it.
or whatever language people prefer, even python if we have to.
I’m wondering how u run python code from the game engine, which uses c# or c++
Unreal uses c++
But I think there’s hardware requirements for unreal
Not sure
i can already imagine sleepless nights.
Ikr...
Someone should kill the judge
😂😂 it's the people
😒😒😒😒
😒
What???
20k laptop, 70k GCard
Instead of a new laptop buy this for ur desktop
i5 4460 will bottleneck it
😂😂😂😂
it needs a i7 "K" processor
overclocked ones
Chuck ur i5 and buy that then
Spectre and Meltdown
It also costs 70k?
waiting for 9th gen intel processors
😂😂😂😂
😂😂
i ain't buying anything until those get fixed.
Ya best not
and the fix is slowing down windows
U r doing the innovation challenge stuff rite?
and it killed some of Windows installs running on AMD processors
now ?
-_- we don’t hv soo much time uk
😂😂
College will start in 10 days or so
help me solve this
and then i'll be doing everything you say
//www.codechef.com/JAN18/problems/KCON
Go read Tht book I sent
pakka 1000%
-_-
just this one
and then i'm done with codechef long challenge
i know the brute force method
that solves the subtask #1, but subtask #2 is TLE for me
It’s not working?
Oh
18 points, out of 100
Trees maybe idk
😒
what no
Try brute force only on array A
Then multiply the answer u get with K
will only work if all the integers in A is positive
that case i've already added
Not exactly
Brute force in the sense try getting all sub arrays and then adding them
ohh
that's TLE
Sub arrays can hv num of elements >= 1
since its 10^5*10^5 iterations
U did on array B or A?
B
Try on A
Then multiply answer with K
ok trying that now.
😌 that's sounds too good to be true though
Like for array A={1,-2,1}, sub array with max sum is {1} multiply that with K u get 2
True
There should be an efficient way to find sub arrays instead of the brute force
😒 yup too good to be true
//www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-subarray-with-given-sum-in-array-of-integers/
These ppl used maps
Time complexity is O(n)
Similar q btw not same
I dint understand the logic tho
//www.geeksforgeeks.org/largest-sum-contiguous-subarray/
very similar ^
kadane's algo
It is same
Thts what I was saying
U do this and multiply the answer with K
And tada!
😂😂😂😂😂
Do it on A
exactly what i did
nope that wont work
Why?
write down a series and try it by hand
you'll know
just this question
solve this and then i'm donw
then full time our innovation thingy
mostly
If u treat A as a circular array and then find the max itll work
the sum keeps on increasing in a weird way as the array A is replicated
yeah
TLE
😒😒😒😒
U used this and circular array idea and still got TLE?
yeah because i'll have to iterate through the Array A , K number of times
array A has 10^5 elements
K is 10^5
total 10^10 iterations
that needs approx 100 seconds
and the time given is 1 second
O(n^2) we need O(n) algo
This is O(n)
Huh?
for array A, yes
Array B is essentially same as array A
but i need for array B, so it makes it O(n)*O(n) kind of thing
it does look the same
but the sum doesnt work
Instead of using B, treat array A as circular and do it
Chuck B it’s not needed at all
This will be confusing to do tho
okay so if i do for B, then i'll have to make an array of 10^10 elements, which needs like > 4GB and we get like 200 mb of memory, and if i treat A as circular array and then do it, i'll need 10^10 time, i.e. 100 s, and i have 1 sec
isn't though 😉
Using Tht algo not brute force
Why 10^10 time?
🙃 why not try it yourself once,
you'll know
and use python 3
python 2 doesnt work
and use raw_input
there are no strings, all integers
raw_input() doesn’t exist in python 3
😪 ```int(input())```
//hastebin.com/unohetuhaf.cs
Did it finally?
no
doesn't work
still 18 points
donno what's wrong
i compared my program's output with the brute force one that gives TLE, and both give same answers.
maybe missing another some kind of weird case
okay my code is WA for the last case, donno why this ^ has AC
maxSum*K gives AC for that last case. and why the hell is that
AC?
Accepted
😂😂😂
Read group messages
U awake???
Yeah
I saw the models
I had found the exact ones before
The non-colour low poly ones
Colouring is easy
Ya?
holy shit
unreal engine is so coooooool
just fukin install it fast
I already did
Wht did u do??
just the first person template
Unity is similar btw
Unity is C#
this is C++
Both r game engines
uhh the models don't work in Blender
extension is .blend
those are like 3ds max files
the tree works
U can import Fbx files into blender
I hv 3ds max...tomo I’ll export the ones into .blend...rite now my windows is updating
I started updating at 5...it’s still going on😒😒😒😒😒
Yeah got that
Blender is fine
3ds max is too much
3ds Maya for animation ?
It’s working?
Yeah
Blender doesn’t hv animation?
didn't see the import thing earlier
Oh
It's there
Windows is shit slow😒😒😒😒😒
TF is that 😂
BTW thanks for telling
I'll turn off my windows update now
😒😒😒😒😒😒😒😒
had almost finished uploading the repository
and github literally crashed
50
how lucky huh
What repo?
//github.com/satyajitghana/InnovationChallenge
Unreal doesn’t hv any built in thingy?
Like how unity had, that collab thing
uhh there's no sharing
😅 lemme check again
nope
its not like Unity
its like a bad version of GitHub
SVN and Perforce
and we would need a SVN server first
Oh
need quick feedback for DEBUG
tell me what you would like to see more
and how was your experience at DEBUG
AI and BCI
they gv Tht feedback form rite? I filled it that time only
//github.com/satyajitghana/InnovationChallenge/blob/master/Assets/Bear/Models/bear.blend
scaled and added the .blend file
//github.com/satyajitghana/InnovationChallenge
leave it, you can do it later
How the hell do I do that?
And sync it with what?
git clone thing
This is windows not Linux
you have git for windows too
i am on windows btw
Software?
GitHub Desktop
and it's GUI
👏👏👏
Did any rigging?
Use rigify which comes with blender...they hv basic rig shapes for quadrupeds which will make things 100 times easier
ok
watching videos
Rigging not working...
why ?
Rigged it, while testing shit is happening
use the wolf rig
😐 what's happening
I rotate the tail and instead of the tail end removing the upper body moves for some reason
I did something is wrong
😕 keep trying
i just started rigging the tiger
Sighhh ya
Won’t be able to finish it by today...thts for sure
okay
I'll try else tomorrow
No I’ll do wolf
yeah
im doing tiger
If u get the tiger rite after testing it in pose mode do the others
yup
//m.youtube.com/watch?v=cGvalWG8HBU
Try following this method while rigging, it’ll make animating them waaaaay easier
It’s called an inverse kinematics rig
I had got the rig yesterday
but the head part doesn't work at all
Oh and somehow I managed to lose the teeth and tongue😓😓😓😓😓
and the head part works ?
using rigify
it had too complex head
Used rigify yest...had more problems actually...this full thing was done manually
I found a video on how to fix it...but it’s complicated
The other wolf should be easier
The IK thing is cool
that is the most simplest rig ever 😒
😂 I was trying the default rigify rig
The second wolf one is perfect
Hv to fix the tail thts all
This wolf model is the same as the second one...the hair stuff is a separate object itself...I guess thts why this one is not working so well but the second simpler wolf is perfect
Simple wolf rigged👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
//www.blenderguru.com/tutorials/introduction-to-rigging
this guy fixes a similar problem to yours i think...in the vid the skirt(pant whatever) doesnt move so he does some stuff
im going to follow this when i fix the wolf 1
tiger rigged 🤣🤣
😂 come back look at my tiger
Select the tiger model, and under the modifiers tab there will be something called armature...in that select the check box called preserve volume
Finished deer 2👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I hope what we did is rite😂😂😂😂😂
i should have preserved the volume earlier
now it doesnt work
no doesnt work
It doesn’t fix it...it only somewhat fixes it and prevents some problems
Use rigifys basic quadruped metarig
I’m using that only
😮
i used the animal rig
huh i should use the basic one then
else it wont be uniform you using the quadruped and me using the animal rig
🤦‍♂ i have to do it again dont i
yeah Tiger done, and without using the Generate Rig thing because you didn't do it either.
BTW why aren't we using the Generate Rig ?
and directly using all the bones and adding weights ?
that wasn't the problem, adding the rig as weight was the problem, i used the envelope and it worked.
Whts this?
What I did:
Import model
Shift-A, select basic quadruped metarig under armature
Scaled and matched the bones with the model in correct places
Did the ik stuff thingy(Tht vid I sent)
Then after that patented the rig to the model by selecting the model then selecting the rig, ctrl+p and selecting the automatic weights option
Btw ur using blender rite?
*parented not patented
The wolf animal rig had stuff for jaws and eyeballs and all so I dint use it
automatic weights broke my model but automatic envelope worked.
yeah 😒
Broke? How?
the preserve volume didn't work in weights
there's a generate rig, after that you attach the rig to the model and then rigging is done
Thts nice but the bones r moving out of the model itself
so you don't have to use the bones to move the character
This is envolope?
yeah
Where?
after aligning the bones
wait
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
if we don't use the Generate Rig what's the point of having that cool little button at the bottom 🤣
I'm doing the goat with generate rig
Goat????
Fixed it...used the .obj model instead of the .fbx
Done with deer
so we don;t use the generate rig ?
No I never did
I’m following wht this dude does
okay i ain't doing it then.
that dude is not using rigify
He uses human meta rig but I use quadruped
He does
oh ok
then it's fine
Some old version which only has human meta rig but the steps stay the same
2.6 blender I think
it just shouldnt cause problems when animating
I don’t think it will
okay goat also done
bear is left
toss a coin 😂
😒 BTW i dont have your Deer 2 model, so sync the github repository and add that
its 700 mb repository so start syncing
and after bear, start animations
tell aryan to get the other assets like a dagger, an axe, and the human hands
U sync I’ll put in in the drive...I dint download Tht GitHub thingy and the first wolf rigging is annoying me
Aryan should do some of the animations
leave the first wolf then
Noooo
so then aryan does all the animations ? and we can start with something else
because it looks nice ?
The first wolf looks like a wolf, the second one kinda looks like a dog
Ya
😂😂 yeah
Ya more or less
texture and coloring to be done in UE4
👍🏻
U rig the best and I’ll finish the wolf
ok
*bear
so bear is human rig or the quad thing ?
Quad
as per the model its standing
Keep it simple
Wait wht?
okay its not
lemme check
okay its fine
its quad
It might be difficult rigging this
It’s in some weird pose
its ok
what next ?
U finished bear???
ya but it needs a little improvement
the legs have some problem
Use weight paint mode to fix stuff
that bear has thick legs and they are too close
Thts how I’m fixing the wolf thingy
Send vid ?
shut-down
sleeping
Send when u get up then
Finished rigging the first wolf model, I put it in the drive
Wht r u gonna do today?
I need to fix my models
actually redo my models
The rigging?
they sent using IK thing
*arnt
yeah
Use the links I sent
I followed a different tutorial
where he used the rigify generate rig and then did everything
yeah
This for rigging
yeah yeah
will do today
This for IK
you ask Aryan what he's doing
👍🏻
he probably needs help in getting the forest models
Only part 1 btw...I dint see part 2 and 3
The unreal project stuff is on github?
the forest should be real to life
yup
even the models are on GitHub
Not low poly trees?
Wait
no, since there were many tutorials on how to make a real-to-life forests and it would look nice.
I’ll do the rigging, I’m used to it now so I’ll be able to finish it faster
"photo-realism"
U start with the unreal part
I did goat yesterday with inverse Kinematics
Like learn how to use unreal
so I've a hang of it
Ok so bear and tiger left?
U start with this and AI...we don’t hv much time left
Terrain let Aryan do
even goat is kinda left since I already rigged it before and then when I rigged it again with IK it glitched out.
okay do the other two
see my GitHub repo
We can put some add ins later
I've assembled he bones
Ya 👍🏻
just add the IK bones
I’ll install github too
*extra stuff whatever
Ok so I’ll finish rigging, u start with unreal and AI
And Aryan continues with terrain
I’ll join u with unreal and AI stuff after I finish rigging
This is rite rite?
okay
Crap I hv to figure out how to use github now😓😓😓
and add the project to UE
😓😓😓😓
Dude...why the hell is the repo huge??
Can I upload to the repo? Or do u need to give me permissions and all?
ya I need to add you as a collab
you already started syncing ?
Add me then
ya will do that
Like soon pls
😒 it's not urgent
Today atleast
yeah sure
I can edit the files I download tho rite?
Download/clone what do u call it
yeah
Oh ok
clone
commit
push
pull
that's what they are called respectively
Oh the terminologies
Ok 👍🏻
But it’s faded so I need permission rite?
that's the edit repo part
yup
no
Thts how u use this thing?
there's no text written in the commit message
after commit there's a push
now commit
and then do a pull request
Google how to do pull requests
😅
👍🏻
I don't remember how it's done in the GUI version
you can't push BTW
it won't let you 🤔
*shouldn't
Ya it doesn’t
ya then anyone can edit our repo
Ok I hopefully figured this thing out
pull requests will work
Yup it did
😐 it feels so weird when you go from Blender to UE
the movements are different
shift has no movement meaning in UE
and shift was life in Blender
Ikr
It still is life in blender
added you as a collab
now you can push
👍🏻👍🏻
have you logged in ?
and check your email
Wait
Chuck it it’s working
How big can the repo be? It’s already 700mb
there's not limit 🤔
😂
but there is a upload speed limit
So technically one can use it as a drive rite?
it doesn't go beyond 500kbps
yeah surr
Ohhhh
So why don’t ppl do?
people do
Oh
but they dont because it's the same as using the sword to cut vegetables
Oh
GitHub tracks every small changes made to the files with comments and who made that change
there's very subtle file changes history so if some code goes wrong you can revert back
and also you can see which lines of code were added and which were removed
Ok ya thts over kill
Rogged those animals ?
*Rigged
Finished just now
Bear gv me some trouble
yeah it needed gravity paint
huh
oh the other bear
Ya this bear
//free3d.com/3d-model/viking-dagger-91160.html
It’s called weight painting
Ya this is waaay better
and this axe ?
The blade looks like paneer
this ?
found the bow and arrow and with a quiver 🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂🙂
how will the character see at night ?
there's no torch (those sticks with fire)
This is nice
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Chuck torch moonlight
Every night
😂😂 okay
added them to the repo
I did
When u texted only
uhh we need visual studio enterprise, it's over 20gb, for using C++ with Unreal Engine
the blue print method is GUI an alternative method to coding, that works, but for C++ one VS 2017
if you find a torrent or download sire for VS 2017 send me the link
Why enterprise? Community won’t work??
I started downloading enterprise that's why 😐
//github.com/satyajitghana/InnovationChallenge/tree/master/InnovationGame
//github.com/satyajitghana/InnovationChallenge/tree/master/InnovationChallenge , not needed anymore will remove it later, or just let it sit there. or whatever
but this is what we are to be working on.
Ok👍🏻
Sheesh I don’t like how unreal looks...unity is a lot more cleaner
community version works
you'll be looking at Visual Studio window most of the time
Still...it’s really not nice
oh and there are plenty of tutorials of using an AI in the game
Tht makes things easier
But we should also come up with something unique
Innovation
🙄 but first come up with something that works
Ya
i downloaded like 30 gb of content from the UE store
😅
😂 had to delete some because most of them were useless.
Don’t push 30 gig of useless stuff into the repo!!!
I don’t want to download all that!
Wht all did u get? 30 gig is a lot of stuff
trimmed down to 10.5 gb
Wth...
Is it up in repo?
not yet
you want me to push ?
Can u set it as optional or something?
Or r u using it in the project?
not using it yet, im just seeing how to make a third person shooter game for now, and making a very basic terrain with height map
watching more videos
you out with your family or at home with laptop ?
Home
Leaving day after
U made it?
Btw our game is first person
just have to mount the camera as a first person
why not third person ?
I was about to make a third person shooter with AI
*am about to
Cuz we need to find a model and make more animations
😌 tried using the downloaded map, and then built the lighting, everything was smooth as butter, until it started "autosaving" and windows just hung, had to hard reset.
just look at them 😄
all sorts of monsters and animals
We got our mythical animals
Now if we can extract only the models and make them low poly, change the texture and put it back then all’s good
Wth...
yeah my bad should have clicked cancel when it started saving it.
and they come with weapons too.
No Modern weapons!
It’ll break any sort of immersion Tht may be there in the game
they have old axe and machete kind of weapons
Send pic
i'm telling you it wont work, i mean the bow and arrow, there are plenty of tutorials for gun, and also for the enemies that i downloaded
i made the map, need to add foliage, and then it will be done
and there are animations already included for guns and gun reloading
It will
I’ll see wht I can do
First person is decided tho rite?
🤷‍♂
make it third
it would be easier
I donno
whatever you find easier
the map will be ready though
I hv a vague idea on how to do it in unity, so I hv to make it in unreal
Very vague mind u
First person will be easier...we’ll only need to animate the hands not the whole body
okeh
my i5 4460 is clocked at max 3.20 Ghz but now UE4 is making it go upto 3.43Ghz, how cool 😂, only sometimes though. and then the editor hangs.
dude
of I try these in my laptop
it will die
in an instant
NO, JUST FUKIN NO.
even 8gm ram sometimes maxed out while opening some meshes
though after compiling shaders and light everything is smooooth
just foliage was left 😭
will do tomorrow then 😓
Don’t torture u poor laptop
Seriously
I won’t be surprised if it explodes
roughly took 40 mins for the tree to fully load
👍👏👏
holy shit, look at those details
UE is like your frame rate hs been below 10fps for 90% of the time 😂😂
but daaaaaamn the tree looks good.
they should give extra points for my tree 🙄
I pushed my map to GitHub, now will add details and foliage, and I'll bring the complete folder with the content downloaded in my hard disk.
Dude low poly trees also
Not like as the style, but keep the polygon count less
It’ll be faster then
this only happens during compiling
and building
while running the game it's 40+fps
On ur laptop or desktop?
desktop
Check laptop
🤣
send me that pic you took of the Mac address
I think I lost it
Sejal’s?
yup thanks
forward that DEBUG messages I sent in our class group to J section.
tell their CR
ASAP
Put it on the debug communication group
U guys did create Tht group for this
Idk who’s the J section CR
Don’t forget electronics manual printout
😂😂
you got kicked out of the group
send that Sanobar's pic
😒😒😒
Stupid Sanobar
I'll change the icon again 🤣
😂😂😂😂😂😂
yeah java is slow
😂 you realised it so early huh
Lwjgl is java
Light Weight Java Game Library
Minecraft is written using lwjgl
For what we’re doing normal java is fine...it renders a bit slowly on Linux(for a shit number of reason, either kernel issue or some driver thing I couldn’t find out exactly) but it runs perfectly in windows
If I hv time I’ll do the lwjgl stuff
Most probably u and Aryan will be doing the AI stuff
Did u learn anything about A*?
Like what it needs(inputs) and wht it gives out(outputs)?
As in
y=f(x)
Where y=outputs, f(x) is A* and x=inputs
I’ll need to noe this actually
A* algo in context of AI and stuff for the project
uhh will see now.
😒😒😒
30 ?
because of that exhibition.
According to CR group and past history 11-1 = exhibition and then classes will resume
you are not attending next class
Nope if u attend I will literally kill u
EC class right ?
and those two monkeys also
No both classes
Hey when we were learning C u said something like windows cares or doesn’t care about something...I think the context was pointers...u found out Tht ur code worked in Linux but not windows cuz of some reason...wht was it?
Some program...not sure which
not sure about the reason, i had used my code in linux netbeans and everything worked but not the same in windows, i never really figured out why though
There’s a similar problem in the program...error doesn’t occur in java code, but whatever OpenGL stuff it calls
Works on Ubuntu but not in windows
Or specifically works on intel but not Nvidia
//linuxacademy.com/community/posts/show/topic/17005-vnc-viewer-showing-black-screen
How do I push stuff in Ubuntu?
Is there a desktop app?
not in Ubuntu.
use ```git add . ``` then ```git commit -m "message"``` and then ```git push -u origin master```
I found out how to increase font size in eclipse! That too by fluke!😄😄😄😄😄
finished A-star though it needs fixing. 😐 360 lines of hand typed code.
Needs fixing? Wht do u mean?
Ahem...869 lines of hand typed code...excluding the stuff I did yesterday
this was in a day ☹
needs a comparable interface on Pair Class.
that is the only issue
and there is no autocomplete in vim
so every time go up see the class members.
and the variable names also don't get autocompleted
my code is not how geeksforgeeks did it.
🤦‍♂ see the size of their code. they do the same operations for all 8 directions
instead make a function.
not sure why they did it like that.
for now 0 errors 37 warnings 😂
look at DEBUG Freshers
told you people will be kicked out.
Two ppl r still there
A Star Works !
tell me how your input method works so i can modify my a star to convert that input to boolean array and give you the output in your format.
when we are free in class.
or tell now, i come early to class.
tell the input part
like how will you give me the grid.
as of now it uses input from user 😅 for testing.
Got collision!!😄😄😄😄😄🎉🎉🎉🎉🎊🎊🎂
uhh
cake ?
Random typing
Dude we need to make a nice method of filling that hash map...both of us need it
Like a hash map where the key is the cell number and the values r the list of entities in Tht cell
the Key is a "Cell" ? like the object of Cell right ?
No no
As in cell number
It’s an int
Wht is Cell class Tht u use?
it should be a pair of integers, (x,y)
see AI package
Ur class? Not inbuilt?
Wth is i,j,f,g and h?
f g h are used for heuristics. like the Euclidian distance of source to destination and all. do one thing since you only need to store. (x,y) use the Pair class.
We’ll discuss in the class...Tht time explain be the basics of the classes
Update repo btw
Which includes reorganisation of the AI package
Added the map in EntitesMap class
And and FPS counter
Game runs at 60 FPS 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
okay
Wth...what does this mean?
It’s cool tho somehow
definition of chaos
😛
Meaning re
What does it mean?
when a DE doesn't give a proper solution it gives chaotic solutions
😂
😒😒😒
That has no relation with DE
it does
see chaos theory in maths
Math has chaos theory 😳😳😳
How does approximate future and all come with that?
it's just a formal definition kind of thing.
Still
😂 you will be scolded by Sejal
for your DP
Thts my default DP
Hey send me the charging discharging readings and calculations noe?
Gimme AI!!!
gimme a function that checks if the (x,y) is valid or not and also another to check if (x,y) is blocked or not.
you wanna go NMIT ?
Yup
But don’t tell me Tht the events r next week
The 24hr hacathon👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
I’ve gone to one of those in DPS east last year
Well, it was a total flop tho
We can use our innovation challenge code and improve on that😎😎😎😎 basically cheat😎😎😎😎
No not cheating, we’re following one of the paradigms of coding, “never reinvent the wheel” 😎😎😎😎
AND ILL GET FUCKING LIGHTING TO WORK BY THEN
Maybe
Hopefully
The fest is for all years noe?
And PG ppl
?
ya
Bunking EC to program shaders
Or atleast make the program use the most basic shader
Hopefully I’ll finish this
U can also bunk
BUT finish the AI thing if ur bunking
Then do whatever u want
Plus ull miss Tht annoying test sir said he’ll give
you'll bunk 2 hours EC ?
attendance ?
Priorities
Hopefully I’ll get proxy somehow
even we're bunking
Ya rite nice bunking 😒
did Vaishnavi send you some message ?
Crap ya
😂
we're bunking
after 12pm
after MATLAB
so . . . 😁
what did she send you , send ss
so it was a broadcasted message 😂
Ya duh
Wht do u expect?
😂
I thought maybe it was a little modified for individuals
Ppl r not jobless like u😂😂😂😂
Dude I can’t push
Having merge conflict in .gitignore
No
*nm
Used some force option
Just check if it dint break the repo or something
ok I'll see
will do and send
I don't remember how I did it.
👍🏻
Wtf😂😂😂😂
Just a substitution 😂😂😂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
When I saw Tht e^shit I thought it was wrong
yeah
these substitutions are very rare
Totally
Wth😂😂😂😂😂
ikr 😂✌
Dude if I hv to ellipses which r defined by there eq, how do I check if they are intersecting?
Like comp wise
Mathematically if u can solve them then they r intersecting but if u hv to rite a prog to check if they’re intersecting then what?
you can assume the ellipse to be a rectangle
so it's would be a little easy
the collision blocks are usually rectangles or squares
I was thinking of using ellipse eqs...it’ll be easier in detecting and i think also when the object rotates
Is there an eq for a rectangle?
Basically my issue is that if the object rotates by like 60 degrees, everything gets screwed up
Unless the object is symmetrical like a circle
nope, but a piecewise equation, yes
why 60 ?
Eg
Any amount of rotation actually
It’s not a major issue but still
Oh whenever u hv some small free time, think of some nice minimal kind of background pic
flat backgrounds ?
Suitable ones
Like a minimal dungeon
Idk chuck minimal then
It should not look cheap👍🏻
give me a function that return the total number of rows and columns of your map.
Ok two separate functions tho
use my Pair class
Huh?
Oh
Send me how to create a Pair object with two ints
ya
Pair has a constructor
Those <> thingies?
wait
Pair <Integer, Integer> yourObject = new Pair(2, 3); if the coordinates are 2, 3
in between those angular brackets you can give any two data types
even like an Integer and an ArrayList
basically any two Classes which have Inherited Object Class
so anything actually
* new Pair <Integer, Integer>(2,3);
😂😂😂
😅 its should be specified even in the constructor call
"Generics"
Sounds like a hashMap kind of thingy
🤣
Like key - value pair
Make a list of Tht and u hv a pseudo hashMap thingy
yeah, just that i have removed the hash map quality, so duplicates are also allowed
Ohhhh
yeah.
you had that AI FUNCTIONS
///////////////////////
thing noe ?
put there
i think i might not need the map dimensions
but for now just add it,
tell me as soon as you do that
my part is done
dont push wait.
i just changes the methods you added to static 😅
or you can push no problem
no major changes
What did u do??!
ok done
see
gimme x and y
i mean size of map
you know, making it static might be something really fucked up
but let's see
not sure how the local variables in that class would work with static methods.
if it doesnt work, you can always change it so . . .
isnt the size of the map constant ?
It is
yeah okay, push
oh wait
pull first noe ?
since i made changes
And I had to change the visibility of ur Pair class constructor to public
It was default
uhhh, so if you push now, not sure what will happen
I’m pulling
okay
yeah
git merge
use that
your kraken thing has git merge
I’m seeing wait
force pull ?
open in external merge tool ?
whats that
//stackoverflow.com/questions/4785107/resolve-conflicts-using-remote-changes-when-pulling-from-git-remote
“The configured merge tool was not found”😂😂😂
//bruno.defraine.net/techtips/handling-merge-conflicts-with-git/
there's a git checkout, git merge, git rebase
lotta stuff to handle merge issues
I somehow did
Clicked pull twice and it worked
Dude why is everything static?
okay
It won’t screw stuff up noe?
only AI functions were made static
in my ai code everything is static
Cuz each enemy should be able to calculate their paths to their destination without interfering with each other
if it works, dont touch.
Ok let’s see if it works
I have to make stuff static now
I have a getPath() that takes in source and destination in the Pair, Pair format and gives you a stack of the path.
U don’t have a Boolean array anymore
I'll remove the grid array once I add that size of your map thingy
The function which I made?
yeah I haven't added that yet
because you didn't push that yet noe.
I pushed
Pushing again
After making stuff static
Pushed
me too pushed
now see
call that getPath(Pair source, Pair destination)
it should give you a stack of the path.
Is there a toString function for stack?
So I can see the coordinates?
hmm, there is but it might not work, if my pair class has toString it would work
Or I’ll use normal for loop to see what’s in the stack
What’s in the stack anyway? Pairs noe?
Nm
What do u mean when “source of the destination is blocked”?
* source or
😅 typo
I call your is unblocked method with the source and destination coordinates to check if either the source or the destination is blocked.
Wait
I had asked u to offset the destination a bit
So the enemy won’t go crashing into the player
you can call my method with a offset destination
How do I calculate the offset then?
I’m also getting “destination is invalid thingies
When this happens, the stack isn’t updated noe?
if the destination lies outside the map then it will give invalid
no, it should be null.
or empty
Destination is valid only
I’ll check the validation code again
hmm ☹ I'll see when I get home
Ok in the mean time I’ll check whether what’s printed is rite or what
It calculates the path correctly
But if my enemy starting location is 700 ur code gives arrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
aah, I think I know, why you send the size of your map, send the number of rows and columns as row +1 and column+1
*when
Fixed this
Ok I’ll check
was it a problem on your side ?
Still outOfBounds
The invalid dest thing? Ya it was I had flipped the checking conditions by mistake
aah ok
Wait I did +2 since I subtracted one in the constructor
not sure then, will have to see, I only have two arrays so it should be easy
Now I’m getting null pointer somewhere so I’ll check that wait
and you can add a catch exception to check which block of the code throws the arrayindexoutofbounds error
Dude
waddup
😂
Ur code is trying to check whether a nonexisting cell is unblocked or not😂😂😂
oh
so I have to check if the block is existing or not first
🤔 I think I already did that
No check line 124 of Asearch.java
The loop conditions if it exists
what if you add validate cell inside your cellisunblocked ?
I mean let validate cell be there where it is.
copy it to cellisunblocked
Then what should I return if cell doesn’t exist?
false
False?
Basically validate then check
all invalid cells are blocked so.
yeah
Dude check ur function call
I think u flipped x and y
Cuz validateCell works perfectly now, I checked it also using players coordinates
U want me to push the stuff which makes an error?
Ok I pushed it
So when u run, it’ll give error
check for array index out of bounds again
i had swapped the max rows and max columns in my cellDetails array, 😅
and there are only two arrays i used so that could be the only problem
there's that NullPointerException still
Push ur code
yeah see now
Line 294
Check ur code again for any other switches u made by mistake
whats the problem there ?
there are no pointers there.
one array
and one method call
and arrays by default have some values and arn't null
Ya the i, j values r causing the problems
the exception took place at line 82 of Entities
Flip them and see what happens
The map doesn’t contain a key like that so error
so why arn't you catching that exception, if the key doesnt exist then return false
Oh like that
Wait I’ll try
so if the key doesn't exist then why does validateCell allows it to go further ?
🤔
It works
what works 🤣
But wait a sec...if ur codes fine then the map should not been initialised rite wait I’ll check
As in it doesn’t crash
aah
push push push
Wait
Dude how do I stop those things from printing?
Like in ur code
Where is it?
what do you want not to print ?
is there like a verbose mode kind of thing in java ?
No i need to print something else
So I don’t want this in the way
line 110 ASearch.java
and if you scroll a little up you'll see more print statements
doesn't java have a separate Class for logging and stuff ?
Android Studio had a different log thing
Ya I found it
Dude check that part again in ur code...the error should not come
what ?
Basically x=[0,35]...it’s the number of rows in the thing...when u increment x, row coordinate should change or column coordinate?
you said it was fixe
rows
Cuz in tht invalid destination, u had used x in such a way that incrementing it would change the current column
oh ya
it changes column
Ya and in this null pointer exception it changes row
as in an array
So somewhere it’s flipped
Ya
Damn this is confusing
How did u take ur x and y as?
Make sure ur consistent everywhere and cross check it
just imagine an array, (x,y) are like arr[x][y].
if i increment x, then i am going down
Ya
Then this?
if i increment y then i am going right
Changing column is like going left and right
this is what i did
x goes up and down
y goes left and right
Then the null pointer thingy way is rite
Then why do I get destination invalid?
🤷‍♂
change the system out println and print the coordinates and see
something wrong with validateCell then
Nope
Wait
validateCell is fine
So r ur cords
But still I’m getting destination invalid
use brackets properly ?
put brackets everywhere
🤣 just to be sure
huh weird
So ur sending me switched cords
then you switch the coordinates back
Then I’ll get null pointer
😂😂😂😂
then you return false
Don’t be lazy go check ur code
catch that exception
Then it won’t work properly it self
😒 it used to work before
Ur sending me y, x sometimes and x, y sometimes
🤣
ok I'll standardize it use Pair everywhere
Ya and don’t end up switching it in the constructor also
Even I have to use Pair...it’s useful in someplaces
ty ty ✌😂
Use Pair and push it...I’m sleeping now
👍🏻👍🏻
I'm sleeping too
too tired
...
😱😱😱😱😱😱😱
😑 I'm not staying back anymore
World is ending!!!!!
Till 8/9 and all?
😂😂😂😂
not even till 5
😑
Good sleep is very imp...I dunno why u guys give me some weird look when i say proper bio stuff, like tht melanin thing today
😂🤣😂
🤣😂
🤣
Something happened?(if I may ask)
I donno
will see tomorrow
not sure
👍🏻
Tomo no college btw
I might be going
not sure
😅
College will be open?
Oh ya they do hv a hostel there😛
hostel will be 🤣
yeah
👍🏻
Hope everything goes well
hopefully
you fixed the null pointer and pushed ?
U said u would do everything using Pair
So waiting for that
Anyways I doubt I’ll do anything today
Phy portions r a lot compared to other sub
aah okay.
yeppp
🤣
yup
Oh good
Hey can u send the MI of circular disk derivations?
will start studying later
consider a circular thin wire
and do
Aeyyy
Too lazy to think
🤦‍♂
Shyamant
ping me when you are free
Ya I’m free
what you doing during college fest ?
Programming
Wait when is it?
what ?
^^
end of this month or something
If it’s before assignments then I’ll be doing the assignment and the innovation challenge
no it's obviously after
Then no clue
Haven’t planned anything
So god noes
Why?
we are planning to go to Goa
Who?
March 16 AKAIRA starts
us four
Lol my mom won’t let
why ?
it's only once noe
Goa and all complete no
not like we are going everyday
Ik, but even then she won’t let
tell her noe that all friends are also going
my mom also won't let
but if everyone is going she can't say no
It’s a mom thing so idk...she told me in the beginning of college only
and it's only once
Nope that won’t happen
told you not to go to Goa before college ?
Sorry bro?
😐😑
no you are coming
it's a one time thing
you won't get this chance again
that's why
No like no going on trips and all...she dint let my sis only go, and my sis finished 4 yrs of college
arre still try noe
there's always a first to everything
I’ll ask
Who four and when?
and tell that Shubham and me are also there
And how long
and we are bored with studies and need a little break
so going
Shubham, me, Sejal and you.
Rishika, Prachi, Shivam and Shashank.
Btw how the hell r u going to go to goa?
that's all
that is to be decided
😂😂😂
by car probably
I’ll ask
5 days max
K
and it should be a yes.
That I can’t promise
it has to be that
😑
Let’s see what happens
I even have to convince Sejal
Wait we hv holidays?
AKAIRA won't have attendance
so holiday only
Akaira is for how long?
Friday, Saturday
16,17
I
*ok
Dude AI
Finish the Pair thingy
I'm doing maths assignment
Give it by tomo
The code
Seriously
I also need time to do stuff
arre
did you ask btw ?
🤨
oi
instead of Goa if we go to Pondicherry then ?
by train
it will cost way less
I got screwed 👍🏻
She’s like no going out of station anywhere
why why ?
it's only for 2 days
and we have holiday
because of fest.
explain her no
even I know I will get screwed badly if I ask my mom, she will be like go and study.
but we need a break for once.
I did
silent treatment doesn't work on your mom ?
She was like u dint want to stay in hostel and now u want to go out of station?
Lol I’ll get kicked out of the house
you didn't want to stay in hotel ? wtf
yeah that's what we want anyways
Hostel
Not hotel
ya that
Ya not me...I want nice food and bed and my room
🤦‍♂
for two freaking days
not like we are going every month or something
Sorry bro
not even every semester thing
arre
come
you are coming
I definitely don’t want to get screwed again
😑 I have to spend 2 days convincing my mom
and it better be worth it.
😑
Atb😂😂😂
I'm already screwed for using my bank to withdraw money without asking
😑
I'm taking a fucking risk
Duh
😒
yeah so
Then don’t
She’ll probably let u do it in like 3/4 ur
*yr
yeah
we'll go to goa in 3rd year ofcourse
but for now Pondicherry is fine
for starters
Either way, by tomo u hv to finish the AI stuff...and make sure u don’t switch any arguments in the function call or while making a Pair object...like seriously double check everything
I'll manually test it will a rectangular grid.
either way you are coming to Pondicherry.
16-17
it will be a holiday
I can’t come🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
😒
wrong answer
It’s the only answer I can give
😭😭😭😭
^^^???
not done
U do noe Tht we hv to finish it by Thursday rite?
And I still hv to link up ur code with mine rite?
yeah . . .
And u do noe we hv assignments also rite?
yeah . . .
doing assignments
. . .
Can I hv ur assignments?
For ref
😒
uh huh
"reference"
I wont make the same mistake again👍🏻
😂 yeah ok. i guess sumanth sir also knows now.
😅
So give it by tomo
The AI stuff
will try
No try and all give it by tomo
Oooh btw next Monday which movie?
huh ?
movie ?
😂
oh
not sure
Assignment submission day
you wanna go for a movie or laptop ?
No laptop
we'll see
Dude...why...ur laptop😪😪
🤣 you wanna try on yours ?
it's a 3D plot, thought doesn't look like one.
*though
I would like my laptop to live
Thts assignment?
nope
how can I put a moving image in my assignment
😕 I wish I could though
Idk but u can put a 3D plot
Dude we changed the game theme
Instead of dungeon crawler it’s some time pass game which u find in phones😂😂😂
It still fits with what we’ve done till now
And finish the AI
got timings for the innovation challenge...looks like we have to bunk lab on thursday
ya
Finished it ?
slept
U do know that 8th is the day we hv to present noe?
And thts like day after tomorrow you know?
yeah
did you get any message from Chirag ?
Nope
No Idk wtf r u talking about?
Bro VIT dev conference😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
aah you got the invite 😂
✌✌ yeah
I think I could ask my mum for new laptop
U going?
😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
yeah ♥
take one printout of the Carpentry Model 1 , have to write it again
ill draw the diagrams and write the stuff in class.
Dude ur ASearch line 294 is causing a lot of problems
aah
add one extra to the size of my 2D arrays, there are only two arrays
since you use your map from 1 to 700
but my arrays is arr[700]
U do ur classes editing
so 700 is out of bounds
It’s coming outOfBounds at 37 not 700😒😒😒
And ur idea of using try catch to catch the null pointer doesn’t work
Cuz it returns false the areas where the invalid destination thingy was happening now gives source or destination is blocked
hmmmmmmmmmm
What hmmmmm
We hv to fix it!
The final day is day after!
ya ya
I’m pushing stuff
okie
I hope ur trying to fix it😑😑😑
Pushed
😅
What?
nothing
So ur not fixing it 😑😑😑
Idiot
when did I say that
Ok good u r trying to fix it
did I say that ?
Asshole
😂
Shut up and go do
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
Now go fix it
you want me to redirect these people to you ?
No thank u and ignore them
of rows is 35
weird
Figure it out
Seriously
the code you pushed has out of bounds error ?
Yup
keh
Do the same thing like the vid
U get outOfBounds
ya
U figured it out?
nope
Try figuring out why it’s 37 instead of 35
How r u initializing ur array/list?
by default values
Cell[][] arr = new Cell[row][col];
Makes sense if the name is cells rather than cell btw...a cell can’t hv more cells in it
Oh no
*nm
Cell is a class
So this basically is the whole game window rite? With 35 rows and 63 columns
Now what r the iterating variables value?
*values
yes
i and j , they can go anywhere, your function is valid should tell if i and j are valid or not.
Is Tht necessary? I mean can’t u just make i go till rows and j go till cols?
The issue is happening here I think
Or is it like the iterating variables aren’t in for loops? U increment/decrement them based on the path in current direction ur trying to find out?
but I should be able to go in any direction any time
i and j will surely increment , and in any direction possible
but you have to tell me if I can move or not in that direction
The problems here
Damn u want to bunk electronics to figure this out?
Don’t tell anyone else
he might solve the assignment today
We can ask Shubham to write it down
Sejal also will write it
we already bunked his class before
We’ll tell him next time
If he asks
Tht we had to prepare for the innovation challenge so we couldn’t come for his class
If he asks, I’ll talk to him
Otherwise chuck it
I need attendance
Eh...taking it literally Tht is one false statement
😒 ahem . . .
I meant it literally
Like if some one asks u why pencils hv erasers then saying cuz ppl r not perfect is not the right and
*ans
I think pencils hv erasers cuz it convenient
😛😛😛
😒 whatever
But ya I get what it means😝😝😝😝
My bad🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻🙏🏻
😂😂
what happened ?
Nothing
Cuz of the 😒 emojis
oh ok
i complained about you to your , ahem . . .
My what😑
send those calc pics
❤❤❤
🖕🏻
accha awww
😂
♥❤♥❤
😒😒😒😒
❤♥❤♥♥♥❤♥❤♥♥❤♥❤♥❤♥❤♥❤♥♥❤♥❤♥❤♥❤❤♥♥❤❤♥❤♥❤♥♥❤♥❤♥❤♥♥
😆
Screw u
Train ticket to vellore costs less than an auto ride from byapannahalli to my home😭😭😭😭😭😭
ohh
200 rupees
To go 5/6 km I think
ohh
😂
Wtf
Not fair
Seriously wtfffff
that's public transport this is kinda private transport thing
Idc
It’s still not fair
send that ED folder you copied to your laptop
He dint copy anything
Just plugged it in and checked whether it was there or what
i don't have it.
He only has
Btw I think I fixed it
No more null pointers
No more ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
No more destination is invalid
Path calculation seems fine
Although movement calculation (my thingy not urs) is wrong now...for some reason the enemy circles the player in a very big circle😂😂😂😂
oh
its fine
we will call it AI Tactics
🤣
its actually good if the AI Circles, so the player would have to move atleast
This is happening cuz the coordinate system I use for rendering stuff on the screen is with 0,0 at lower left...now since the mapping coordinate system is changed, the direction calculation is screwed up😓😓😓😓
send this in the group
😂 take a look at it
i made some changes
and made it a PDF
wooo hooo
Lol they’ll ask on the group then where’s the rest
Or they’ll ask me
ohh ya
ask sanobar to send in group
🤣
U give it to her
I need to figure this out
aah ok
you do your thing
Stupid program
😞😵🤦🏻‍♂❄😅😳☠☠😭❄❄🙏🏻☠😭❄❄🤦🏻‍♂
👌👍👍👍👍
that doesn't make sense, str.replace("❤♥❤") 🤣
🖕🏻
😂 ya that makes sense too
Screw u
The enemies fuse😂😂😂😂
Hinding Tactics !
nice
*Hiding
If u hv multiple enemies, their paths coincide and at the end the position also ends up being same😂😂😂😂
so one enemy can hide inside another ?
woahhhh
😱
nice nice
new features
Fluke features😂😂😂
♥❤♥❤♥❤
😂
😦 the background is repeating tile ?
it doesnt blend properly
anyways leave
it's nice
U won’t notice only with the lighting on
Or off
oh ya
GOD mode is on
There’s an issue with the enemies getting stuck in the gate but thts fine
Yup
Btw I had to change ur code to
*too
Initialisation of arrays
change what in that ?
to what ?
I flipped first and second
oh ok
And it worked
np
Pathfinding success👍🏻
ok
🤣
there's something else
lot of code is commented on my program
remove that BS
it looks very bad.
👍🏻
send your physics torsional pendulum readings
quick
Shoban has my manual
One sec wait
Ya I don’t hv a pic of it
get your Phy manual from Shoban
I should submit it today
U finished math?
And ur part in EC?
Matlab stuff
no
I'll do that now
U will give math noe?
Matlab wallas
yep
pakka
By when?
Don’t tell Monday
tomorrow
today should finish EC and Mech no e
I just woke up
Ok
Busy tone
Screw it
We’ll give it max by Tuesday
If they call again to confirm or something tell we’ll give by tue/wed
he says by today, since he has to give it to VC.
Chuck it
Seriously wth
Assignments also r there dude
First of all for a vid I think all three of us should be there
yes, he even said the group members should have their photo
tell him after 12th
or tell the VC to give us more time for assignment.
this is better.
I called
He said give by Monday evening
So morn we hv to make the vid somehow
The dudes name is Rahul Singh
wtf no
He has to give it to VC by Monday evening it seems
tell him that he should extend our assignment submission date.
Ya the dude doesn’t hv the authority to do tht
He sounded like chirag😂😂😂
ya kinda
Ok doing on Monday and giving the vid on Tuesday morn
Chuck telling them that we’ll give on Tuesday
If they ask we’ll say assignments
EC you did both of those questions ?
Did first
Dint get the last one
Shubham did half of last one but the last two qs I also dunno
Hv to google I guess
ok ok do it by today, i am also still doing
you did mech ?
Ya
Except debate
It was torture
send mech noe
K
My first q part b, they told to do some apartment or academic something survey but I couldn’t find anything, so I managed to do full India household survey😂😂😂😭😭😭
dont send it to anyone
seriously
yeah
Can u send math?
MATLAB part is wrong, shubham told, so i have to do that again.
debate not done.
Even u used wolfram😂😂😂
to check yeah.
```dsolve```
Well mines completely different
though the answer will be same
Nope Tht only is dif
I got 3 digit ans for hours
time for the polutants to be free ?
or what ?
Ya wait I’ll send
oh ok
then its fine
even 6 digit answer is ok.
U got 5000 hrs or so
How?
depends on the newton-raphson tolerance
and the number of iterations
i set it to 10^-200
and 10 digit precision.
Not exactly
wolfram also agrees
There’s no need for newton rap son
is that the equation for t=0 to t=120 hours ?
there are two equations
after 5 days walla
after 5 days one is a exponential decay
i sent the assignment see
theres no e anywhere
under case ii
there is.
imagine like a capacitor discharging
thats like the lake getting rid of impurities
aaah u dint take the (t-120) in the denominator
the capacitor discharging is e^-t/tau
i did what u did in the beginning
see the links i sent on the group
the question is literally the same
except the numbers
oh ok
check your Q(120)
confirmed from wolfram it should be 94469... yours was 7938...
Ok wait
i didnt factor in the volume of the lake 😅
🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
Used wolfram to cross check diff eq
//www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%27%3D842000-21y%2F5000,+y(0)%3D25000000
is this correct ?
//www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5000000%2F21+(842+-+737+e%5E(-21+x%2F5000))&lk=1&rawformassumption=%22ClashPrefs%22+-%3E+%7B%22Math%22%7D
//www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=5000000%2F21+(842+-+737%2Fe%5E(63%2F125))&lk=1&rawformassumption=%22ClashPrefs%22+-%3E+%7B%22Math%22%7D
Q(0) is 25000 😐😑 ?
its 25000000
1 tonne is 1000 kg
🤣 i'm still going to keep my newton rapshon
It’s in kgs only noe?
Holy shot
*shit
It’s tons
Crap
Crap
Crap
But it shouldn’t make any major changes
Only C will be effected
yep
that's it
yes
send EC B1 part
and also do the last question before you go to sleep
when i finish mine i'll send it.
I’m doing that now
👍
and i'll do mech when you sleep.
and ED ?
tomo
morn
hopefully
B1.4 will also change btw in maths
since C changes
Ya I did it
Btw is multivariate = bivariate?
superset of that
its like calling is polynomial quadratic ?
quadratic is polynomial
Apparently no ones finding bivariate on net
😂 tell them to search image magnification techniques
Wth...too much image stuff in math
image processing
yeah
last time SVD
this time bivariate
has anyone done that question ?
what answers did you get for B1.4 ?
I don’t think so
79 hrs
i did lagrange bivariate
And 658 hrs
yeah
Thank god
U finished debate?
maths no
i should finish me and ece first
then i should do others
ME is torture
//www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=y%27%3D-21y%2F(5720-6x),y(120)%3D94469377.341
wolfram gives the solution of that DE in imaginary
It’s not just 6x
Look at the link I send idiot
It’s 6(x-120)
that becomes 5720-6x
6000-6(x-120)
thats 5720-6x
Wolframs stupid
I got it properly only
🤣
ya the solution doesnt have a 'i' in it
Btw did EC sir do all Tht alpha and beta stuff for transitors?
ya, he used his "references"
Is the last q in EC use Tht stuff?
not sure
whats the value of C you got in maths ?
that's also correct
nm
4.2 makes no sense in EC
i'm doing that noe ?
oh
you doing that
your problem 🤣
I need hint atleast
gooooooooooogle
Wht do u think I’m doing?
🤣😂🤣😂🤣 i'm not sure, why do we go to college then ?
anyways we have to google
zener done 👍, now need to type it
4.2 done
okay
Btw if u noticed my EC thing I sent, I finished clamper and zener😛😛😛
aah you used the ones that shubham sent
i used different diodes
and different zener
since the frequency is high for the clamper i used a high frequency switching diode
and for the zener i used a 2W diode.
and a 1mF capacitor
Either way, u should rite the correct specifications
Like the data sheet stuff
yep
i'll tell you later whats the problem with the circuits that shubham sent
in theory they will work
practically  no-one makes those circuits
Ya this is assignment so complete theory
your function generator is set to 80V p-p
it should be 40 V p-p
as per the question
Shit ya
I always screw up Vp-p
Even in lab
send the last question of EC
I dint get it
The last two sub qs
😦
they are probably asking for transistor characteristics
graphs
Then what?
Like what explanation would u rite?
From where Ull get this?
The thingy is a common collector amplifier
gooooogle
and Shubham was saying your interest problem in maths was wrong
I used wolfram for this
Like for everything
did you fix your maths ?
I dint see it yet
U did bivariate?
nope
doing mech
EC last question is left
mech two questions only done
Thts all left😱😱😱😱😱
ED also
and maths A1
you ?
Debates left
And ED manual my sis is doing for me
And EC last q
And one graph I dint plot in math
For the pollution q...I forgot off
Dude bivariate?
The matlab part
i'm not done with mech
how will i do bivariate
The program also u dint do?
no
🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
and you can't find the program anywhere on internet
that's the problem
U and problem in matlab🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
do my mechanical
i'll do bivariate
Screw u
😂 yeah so
check your mail
Dude make a vid where u explain A* using some screen recording thingy
Like explain A* with drawing?
Otherwise show ur face in the vid ur wish
By today
Oi idiot
yo

oi
where are you ?
Parking lot
aaah
come in
Near ola zone
Dad went to get platform ticket or something
oh ok
U came alone?
with mom
Wtf😂😂😂😂😂
When u take ur laptop to college, remove the part Tht says under innovation center, rishabh said it’ll cause problems
k
not exactly
??
Somewhat tho
we have it in 3rd sem Discrete Mathematics.
I was reading Shubham bhaiyya's slides
Oh ok
Deep Learning and Neural Networks
I’m going thru it now
Deep Neural Networks
Ya
There was an easier path finding thingy in Tht book😂😂😂
No complicated A* stuff 😂😂😂😂
what
it must be like radius of vision or something
Somewhat...extend a bounding box in front of the entity...if it collides with something calculate velocity correction and apply
that's like emulating a thing that can see and move according.
ability to look anywhere, go anywhere.
Ya

you're not thinking hard enough
🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
Missed voice call
Dude why do u check whether the destination is blocked or not?
just in case enemy is blocked or glitched
Destination is player noe?
oh yeah
so if the player is stuck or something
Not necessary tho rite?
nope
not necessary in our case
👍🏻
Chuck the thing I asked u to do
Not needed
the multiplier is exactly x3
27
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
We should write a paper!
Dude send welding thing
you sleep
Send dude
so jaa kal likh lena
Send idiot
ask sejal
she also has
U send
I am outside
U write nicely

MATLAB released for 2018a Linux 😱
12gb installation file
Wth??
They added about 3gb of extra stuff???
Last time it was 9gb noe?
hmm ya
Sheesh
it released on 15th March
less than a month and cracks for it are floating around 😂
18 GB after installation
Sad ppl😂😂😂
😳😳😳😳
Dude send me the report pattern thing for sociology
dhoondhna padega
I think it might have been lost with my maths book
Search and see noe?
yup got it
and there are 3 IISc reports on the web
one of them has an aerial view of the lake with its chemical composition
We can use the IISC reports in discussion
In introduction normal stuff, like what is pollution and intro to Bellandur Lake
AFAIK sir said to cite the report in intro
Afaik?
or else I wouldn't have written that in introduction
as far as I know
Then flow won’t be there noe? Like intro should be intro and discussion should hv details
hmm okay
I guess it wouldn't make much of a difference
they won't be checking so much details anyways
Hopefully
We both will do discussion
keh
Send the report links noe?
google
i don't have it saved
It’s somewhere in the first page of the search results only noe?
yes
it should be
or dig deep
Ya
So we’ll do how many fire incidents?
whatever you can find
Two major ones is fine...not much is available for the smaller incidents
okay
And then we hv to read the reports to figure out wht all stuff to put in
😂 print that report as is and cite it
And some random “legit” testimonials talking about how residents life is affected and all
😂😂😂
Note quotes
Then done
there's two change.org thingy, where you can find testimonials
real ones
So two incidents and impact with testimonials
Wth
Two change?
2/3 pages can be done with this much I think
Atleast 3
//www.change.org/p/chief-minister-siddaramaiah-order-immediate-clean-up-of-bellandur-lake
Ok all testimonials will be anonymous
//www.change.org/p/dr-harsh-vardhan-union-minister-for-environment-ban-detergents-with-phosphates?source_location=topic_page
And do some rearranging of words so Tht no plagiarism
hmm ok
Make it look like we actually went there and talked to ppl 😛😛😛
So who does what?
🤣 you
do all
😒😒😒😒
U do 2018 incident and testimonials
how many pages ?
I’ll do some other major incident and impact
Since we both 3 so one person 1.5
okay done
calibri, spacing 1.5
11
Yup
Like assignment
say that in that group
you've seen people assignments right, its never the same font, when they copy paste
Ya seriously...it’s common sense
Dude wth is Tht constant coefficient thingy??
where ?
One of the methods to solve second order ODE
Did he do anything like that?
assume the root to be e^mx
y=e^mx
then find y' and y'' and do stuff
Tht formula? Where we ended up proving inverse of differentiation is integration
that's inverse operator
method
Damn send notes noe then?
I don’t hv it
I lost my notes ☹
and we were absent on that day
Crap ya
...
He taught it for one day only?
ya
🤦🏻‍♂
Nm
hmm how did you do it ?
Someone
x^2cosx can be written as Re{x^2*e^ix}
and then use the fact that 1/L(D) is a linear operator
What I did also is rite only noe?
It’s WHAT
your final answer ?
Read the q properly, there’s no question mark 😂😂😂
My method
😂 Somone's mom, so someone, whoever it is, he/she is a someone
yes
“What is the name of the fourth son.” No question mark here
Then good👍🏻
😂 i'm asking what was your final answer for that question
I posted it on iroids see
😂 you know what the solutions of the homogeneous equation called ?
Eigen Values
Huh? Not roots of the eq?
yeah no
Wait oops
m = -1,2 are roots, but e^-x and e^2x are eigen values
When u factorise u get roots😅
Yc?
and they use lambda instead of m all the time, i was wondering why, now i know
Ya even in Tht MIT courseware stuff
Uk what change of plan
U write about the incidents and testimonials, I’ll write about detailed cause...I found shit lot of information on iisc
Too much Chem tho😓
We’ll change only if u haven’t started yet
nope haven't started
Ok then
I found too much info
This would’ve been helpful during the presentations😂😂😂
I got this as Yp
for this
Wolfram gives a similar answer, not exact because it simplifies it even further
Which question? The question I had a doubt in dint hv a 5 anywhere
🤦‍♂ I took L(D) as 1+D^2
but that's the procedure anyways
you'll get 5 regardless
How exactly did u get this?
whats Re(e^ix ) ?
It’s cos x ik but I thought u had to rite cos x as e^ix-i sin x
that's
that will work
aah ok
😂 i didn't realise this
yours in correct then
I’m not sure...cuz I asked Sumanth sir also this and even he said take it as real part of e^ix...I dint understand it too much so i did my way
😂
what
Btw how do u solve those boundary value problems?
U can do the second thing he said, using the general formula and integrating and all, tho I think it’ll be complicated
ok
^^?
Like substitute the given values noe?
yeah
usual thingy
And substitute in y or yc or yp?
they give you y(x) and y'(x) at some points
yep
Which one I’m asking
y
Ok
If they give y’(x) then we hv to differentiate the answer and then substitute???
yes
correct
If they give y’=0?
then let it be
Wht let it be?
you'll still get some c1+c2=something kind of thing
y'(0)=0 can be given
Like in the 6th one
oh ya i tried that last night
Send pic of the substitution parts thtll be enough
Lol it’s sinple😂😂😂
I thought it’ll be some huge thing to simplify😂😂😂
😂 you relaised it too soon hun
😛😛😛
*huh
*realised
🤦‍♂
😂😂😂
Finished sociology?
doing now
you ?
Ya I’m fine
*done
😂
1 and little more than half pages I wrote
Seriously wht sort of autocorrecting is that?
😂😂 stupidness
Yup
send sumanth sir's number
😂 disturb karenge
Dude the way u wrote it, it so sounds like we dint go there and talk to ppl
And not much info about the fire incidents
it's ok
MATLAB works on antergos?
Like the crack
yup it does, i use it in antergos
Arch?
same thing
Ok
Switching to arch
Chucking Ubuntu
No triple booting again, that was a nightmare
keh
why ?
what went wrong ?
It felt heavy
Too many unnecessary things were there
Nvidia ?
Nope, tried starting dhcpcd since Ethernet wasn’t working then Tht happened
see journalctl logs
log in to single user mode
I hv to hard boot it once Tht happens
Ya I’ll try in the evening
It worked before but after I deleted the Ubuntu partition this started happening
Installing antergos is easier?
Like gui and all is there?
yep
Good I think I’ll try Tht mostly
okay good luck 👍
😫 I’ll need it
I already deleted my Ubuntu partition
Now I can’t get grub rite🤦🏻‍♂
See i arch-chroot first
Then mount EFI partition to /boot
Then download and install grub and a bunch of other stuff(pacman)
Then install grub using grub-install —target=blah blah blah
Then generate the grub cfg file
The thing is the first time I did it it dint detect windows
/boot ends up having an EFI folder with folders such as windows and arch and all
Oh and now my vmzlinux files r missing too from /boot
So any idea what I should do?
reinstall ?
you were installing antergos right ?
it has a GUI interface
Arch
try architect
Whts Tht?
installer script for arch
Oh wow
😂😂
you should have asked me before
there's cnchi installer
U could’ve said it when I tripled booted the damn thing
😂 when did you do that now ?
I triple booted arch windows and Ubuntu noe?
oh ya
i remember, and then you removed arch
and its grub thingy
Kernel panic
Architect is not working
what's wrong ?
Cannot find disk by label or some random thing
Tried fixes dint work
Tried renaming but couldn’t rename in windows...plus the name was rite only
Ok I give up I’ll put antergos
😂😂 okay
Solved the grub issue, but now even Ethernet is not working and I can’t shutdown only🤦🏻‍♂
Any other arch/antergos like thingy which can be used for college stuff?( like matlab and all)
manjaro
fedora too ? maybe
ohhh system76
that's a Ubuntu fork
Updates and all is there? Or is it like some random rare thingy and not popular enough
I asked arch based
no no manjaro is quite famous
^?
ya it's arch based
and more popular than antergos
👍🏻
Is it light weight?
Or heavy as Ubuntu?
it's not as heavy, but not as light as pure arch
Antergos vs manjaro based on light weight mess?
manjaro
👍🏻
I HATE MANJARO
STUPID GRUB NOT SHOWING UP
SERIOUSLY WHY DOES THIS ALWAYS HAPPEN TO ME
STUPID GRUB
SJSHDJAKALDO
😂😂
grub never had a problem with me
Dude u hv the MATLAB install file?
For Linux
yup
take it tomorrow
i have 2018a also
Ya I really need it
I don’t have matlab for Windows
And assignments r coming up
I completely forgot
i have windows 2018a too
I’ll take both
I hv to boot into grub in a very weird way...manually select it in bios
I mean why?
Just why???
😂😂 your luck
😭😭😭😭😭
Turns out it’s cuz HP hardcodes the system to boot from windows already or something
its not like tha, mine also boots to windows directly if i constantly go to windows, like 3-4 times, then it defaults to windows
but if i go to linux all the time it shows grub most of the time
I had to press F9 while it booted to go there
And it’s messy
mine is F10 but then after that its like grub, just select where to boot to, and it directly knows which .efi file to use from /boot/efi
😂 like a intelligent device
seee lenovo 😎
I hate how
*hp
I fuckin want to kill Realtek
😂 they are already in your hitlist, along with windows and hp
i guess ubuntu too is now
No Ubuntu is fine
Culprit is here
hmm how ?
PCIe bus error cause Realtek
WiFi problems cause Realtek
Somewhere I read Tht power consumption cause was also Realtek
So ya
😂😂😂😂 mine is realtek toooo
remember
Urs is not rtl8723be
This word is my nightmare
mine is 8821ae
aaah that means mine is a newer card
😭😭😭😭
what did you do yesterday ?
i mean the whole day
This shit in the afternoon
And arch in the morning
I installed arch like 5/6 times yest
And Manjaro 4/5 times
And I only had one usb stick
So I had to boot into windows to create a gparted live disk, remove all shit, boot back into windows and then create a manjaro/arch live disk and install
windows is fine after doing all this ?
i mean no complains from windows side, you doing so much torture ?
torture to the boot partitions and messing up efi
Surprisingly ya
I had to manually edit stuff too😂😂😂
😂 windows was made stupid proof then
it's difficult to mess up windows boot
it fixes itself
And the fix for the manjaro issue is to trick windows into booting manjaros EFI file
Intelligent device 😂😂😂
😂😂
So hv to copy pasting and editing and all in the EFI partition
replacing windows efi with manjaro efi ?
Yup
Backing up windows EFI first tho
hmm ya stupid windows won't even realise
😂😂😂😂
😂 good luck intelligent device
not needed, windows recovery can fix the boot efi
Turns out if u do this u can’t boot into windows...cuz when u choose windows it’ll link back to the same EFI and load grub again...so hv to edit stuff
Aey I hv to download that thing and create a bootable drive then do stuff...safer just back it up and if issue comes, renaming will fix it
add windows to grub then ?
What I don’t get it arch was fine with all this...why is manjaro acting so weird??
donno, it should have worked fine.
😓😓😓
So how’s it perfect?
why would lambda be zero ?
that won't be a wave in the first place
it would be a straight line
Then whts uv catastrophe?
😂 we were absent on that day
Isn’t it when lambda is 0 infinite energy?
Exactly
yup
So how is Planck perfect?
🤷‍♂
WiFi fix is so simple in manjaro😱😱😱😱
third party drivers ?
in software centre thing
Nope even easier
Create a conf file
Add some options
Done
I got shocked
Like really
ohhh
Btw which app?
Ganna?
yup
it's there for iOS too 😄
and there's a web version also
so everything is always in sync
Ohhhh
Lol thts the main thing😂😂😂
From which file u run matlab?
/usr/local
try ``` find matlab ```
in root directory
/bin/matlab
donno where it exists though
I installed it in /opt/matlab but which file to run?
bin/matlab
search for the folder bin
Damn...it’s giving license error
Even after copying the crack
hmm it had worked for me
Nm I copied the server license instead of standalone one 😅
Nice dp
Which nebula?
it was random 😅
😂😂😂
😂😂😂😂😂😂
I’m asking doubt not for the ans🤦🏻‍♂
😳😳😳😳
Dude in the LED blinker circuit, how do u link the frequency of blinking with the resistances and all?
Is it same as source frequency?
no
maybe
i dont know
Nm I somewhat got that q
Using astable multivibrator only
How do u plot the stupid q point in multisim?
Or how do u find it in multisim??
Ya I did that
But I got tons of variables
Which one to choose?
Dif places on the net say dif things...and DC operating point does not plot the load line
*DC operation point analysis
finsihed math ?
Dint start yet
do that first
and Mech ?
Ya I’m doing EC and finishing
i mean do maths first, it will take time
unless you have someone's assignment
I don’t hv
Send noe?
Pdf atleast
i guess you can do it if i give you this
✌ try yourself, if nothing works i'll give you tomorrow
this is the solutions, just removed some extra steps.
physics last question ?
finished everything else in physics
The conversion to second order ODE is that simple?
yup
nope
as i said i removed extra steps
Did everything except debate and that justify whether neutron can be diffracted
those substituting and simplifying steps
sir said to limit pages to 17
U just differentiated the eqs and substituted it noe?
yep
No other fancy method?
Ya thts wht it’s simple
nope
can't use system of DE method. it was way simpler though.
Substituting it is hard?
just that the equations look ugly and large
Ya
at some point of time they looked like this
MATLAB + wolfram + teacher verified
answers in math
😳😳😳
the equations didn't fit so had to do landscape 😂
So u wrote all that???
removed those
Or this is with all those steps cut?
yes
Oh ok
not necessary
Thank god
though still there's a lot to type
thats why do maths first
send me physics last question noe
need to verify
people have done it with all sorts of methods
yep
lol
it got taken down
how'd they know it was a homework question
oh
B1.1 B1.2  😂
should have posted in maths section
why can't people learn to use MATLAB instead
The q is a homogenous one seriously?
yes
Why is there h/a in the H(t) solution?
it comes when you solve it.
actually you can consider that also as constant
I mean merge them into C
you'll still get the final answer
And how come the roots for both r same?
they form a similar auxillary equation
that's why
only constant are different for them
The compute population answer is in terms of constants?
yes
yup
Is it right?
yep
U said the answer should come in terms of constants
you found the constants
But ur answer is in terms of constants
And I dunno if this is right or what
Cuz why r the constants same in both the eqs?
Shouldn’t it be like k1,k2,k3 and k4?
no
solve it manually
I tried, while getting the homogenous eq for the H part I ended up getting an A in the eq...I couldn’t eliminate it
you have relation between A' A and H and also H' H and A
the first order eqs?
yes
differentiate them again
3rd order?!
second order
differentiate once
I meant I got an A after substituting the first order eq in the second order one
Is my ans right tho?
yes
it should be only in A or only in H
Ya i got stuck here
Got A’s in H eq
use previous Equations to eliminate that
told you do maths first it will take time
Dude what’s the error function for the last q last part in math?
there's an error function ?
look at the graph
error function is the function itself
the first thing that sir wrote was the error function
and we are minimizing the error
Huh? But then how do u justify which is better?
eyeballing 😂
What did u do?
Ok I used the function to generate the values of y using x values and subtracted them from the given y values and summed them up
And I called this error
Quad fit gv 0 error
Whereas exp fit gv some -3. Something
You deleted this message
You deleted this message
ok that works
😅
😂 I hadn't done that part
now it's done 😋
How to put multiple labels😫😫😫😫
Stupid thing is overwriting
there's a new line label somwhere
Dude what’s the ans for b2.1 the justify whether the neutron beam can be diffracted by a Crystal thing?
i didn't write that yet, but it should be related to the charge of neutron be zero and its mass being much greater than that of electron.
How is diffraction related to charge?
And mass is irrelevant, size matters
Size of the particle should be comparable with the obstacle
Wait
Wavelength should be comparable
So?
write something
can we calcualte the wavelength of that neutron
Ya thts a q
haan theek hai padh lenge
Reached?
~30 mins
you ?
ETA in
5 mins
Hv to put petrol so maybe 10?
ohkay
what happened to the workshop mock ?
Oops
🤦‍♂
i have a feeling we still have to give mock
Let’s c
Doubt it tho
and we'll be giving it along with some class
😫😫😫😫
Where do u download movies from?
I can’t frikkin use the search bar in yts.am
yts.am
same
or use 1337x
google 1337x use the proxy site.
or thepiratebay
Ya this worked
Says the person who said html is interesting
😂
it wasnt how it looked like
U said it
no formals tomorrow then ?
😌
Look at class group
sociology formals ? 😂
No only for technical
Now look at class group
have fun doing lab in formals
and lab coat on top of formals
Thank u for reminding me😑
you are welcome
👻
😒😒😒
ask sumanth sir if system of DE is coming or not
it wasn't taught in other sections but it's there in previous year papers.
Tomo
what tomo ?
I’ll text sir tomo
no no
call and ask now
and also you can know your marks
Like I want to noe that
And u think I’ll call😂😂😂
ya call noe
Nope
it will be a funnnnnn experience
try
No thanks
Don’t want fun now
😂 the university is having funnnnnn with us
anyways
R u high?
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣
no
are you ?
I think u r
No
Ya u definitely r
💜💜🤣🤣🤣🤣 noooooo
*🤣🤣
No homo!
*🤣🤣
idiot
😂😂😂😂
send Sumanth sir's number, Rishika needs to ask her marks.
that lady is too lazy to go to college.

Finally finished setting up i3 to be usable!
Although I still need to use the terminal to figure out  battery percentage
😌 still waiting for my lappy to arrive
Use i3 it’s brilliant
Take some time getting used to but u can customise the shit out of it
do you happen to have Shankar sir's number ?
SHANKAR SIR (msr).vcf (file attached)
Some advice for u, don’t do all this love business so early, this time can be used more productively and more fully in many other ways
You deleted this message
Omg🤦🏻‍♂ I don’t even have my phone for the past few days cuz my mom took it of cuz of exams🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂
aaaah ok.
Seriously idiot🤦🏻‍♂
I got it now
Discord. Discord, we'll use discord
Ya ya ok ok
Nice one
ty ty 😂
It’s very true when u think about it noe?
yeah pretty much true
Btw dude all slides r coming for the exam noe?
ya noe, 21,22,23,39,40 are not coming
Seriously?
Btw ‘noe’ = ‘know’ not ‘no’
All slides r coming or what?
who said that ?
wave functions arnt coming
and quantum free electron theory is not coming
Schrodinger?
yeah
Coming?
not
lemme confirm
I'll let you know.
👍🏻
ya not coming
these arn't coming
Thanks man
Reached college?
5mins
How do u solve the boundary value problem? Like when they give y(something)=something
And
y’(something) = something
This is boundary value problem only noe?
y(something) = some_other_thing
y'(something) = some_other_other_thing
yeah
so you get the solution y(x) = some_thing right ?  differentiate that to get y'(x), you have the given boundary conditions. and there are two constants, and two equations
its initial value problem BTW
boundary value problem is like defining the value of the function about a boundary i.e. the same curve but at different points
so y(something) = some_other_thing and y(some_other_other_thing) = some_other_other_other_thing, is a boundary value problem
😑 you started this _something_ thing, its a bad practice to do that you know, use ```g(x)``` ```h(x)``` and stuff, there are 26 letters in alphabet.
Ohhh ok I switched it around
Umm the values r constants not functions
still
g(x)=1 is also correct
remember constant functions ?
ya they are always constants y(anything) = should be a constant
😅
🤔🤔🤔 soooooo when will y(something)= some equation
interesting
when will a function output a function
are integrals and differentials functions ?
what is a function ?
what is ```g(x)```
Ayiooo ok ok they r variables which can mean anything 👍🏻
😂😂😂😂
nooo answer my questions
differential is a function or a operator or what ?
integral is a function or a operator or what ?
so differential equations are just a function of operators ?
Hmm...ya makes sense
Dude in this q they’ve given only one initial condition...so how do u find C1 and C2?
yeah
you can't
let it be constant
because only one condition is given
they forgot to give the other
Ok 👍🏻
Variation of parameters on a fourth order differential equation?
Possible?
I’m guessing it is, but u can’t use that formula which sir gave...ull have to derive a different one cuz U’ll get a 4x4 matrix rite?
and 4x4 wronskian
Or is it dependent on the number of roots u get in the aux eq?
Like if there r two roots only u can use sir’s formula rite?
no
I mean it's possible
but it won't come
what sir taught is only for 2nd order
If the aux equation has two roots?
that's when you can use sir's formula
👍🏻
9.6/10 ! what's wrong with IMDB !
😳😳😳
Is it even a good movie?
no idea
but 9.6 is insane
😂 the fans sound like a jet taking off.
😍 it's a 120Hz display
Gimme 😭😭😭😭😭
😂 this is wayyyyyy better than my Lenovo
come at me bro I have 16gigs of ram
oh and 256gb nvme ssd
and 1tb sshd
😍 damnnnnnnnnnnn
this keyboard is soo cooooooool
hey the windows product key comes in as a sticker at the back of the laptop right ?
Woah
I dint hv any sticker when I brought my laptop
Why asking tho?
I thought they provide the product key that way
so where did you get the product key ?
so i was planning to install full on linux on lenovo and let windows run in this lappy
how does that sound ?
and i have a 128gb ssd i'll put that in lenovo, and remove the stupid dvd drive.
or sell the lenovo
wowww the keyboard in this feels so gooood
mushy mushy keys
feel like typing more in this
and the colors are so cool
wish i could program the colors to react to my words per minute thingy, like more faster typing makes the color go red or something
😱 the fans literally sound like a jet taking off while gaming
😂😂😂 wth
Under that system info or whatever in windows I think
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 exchange laptops 👍🏻
Exchange???
I’ll take ur silence as a yes
😂😂😂 noooooo
😭😭😭😭
Red Sparrow
What happened to Monday
pretty interesting stories
October?
If it’s like that or 50 shades hell nothing
*no
what no
and finally I'm watching 1080p movies on a 1080p screen 😂
watch the trailers
😂😂😂😂😂
Hey u want to do some project ?
as in ?
we have Android Project to do
will start tomorrow
and I'll start from scratch
using mongoDB
Chuck the other guys?
umm yeah
they are on holiday
you design the UI and write the code for the chat screen
can you come to college or some common place ?
I just want to finish this android first
as soon as possible
communication would be better
Ya it’s possible, but finish some amount then come or first come then finish some amount
I hv to put android studio on manjaro now
okay cool
okay so let's make the login and register screens today
and everything from scratch
i'll make a normal login and register then you do the finishing part.
since i already have it made.
so it should be easy to make it again
GUI?
yep
This is a q btw I forgot the question mark
👍🏻
API level?
And github?
i'll finish and upload to github
API level android 5.1.1 ?
Sure ur using github only?
I hv no idea abt Android stuff
That is up to u
umm you wanna switch to gitlab or something ? or we could do stuff in modules and later put all the code together, like when you make the chat screen later we can copy paste the code into one place
github sync should also work
assuming we don't push simultaneously which would cause conflicts
pull -> then push
Ya ok
We’ll still go about how sharma sir said, like make a basic app first then go about the whole thing
After making the basic app which can talk across two phones, then we can meet up to discuss about the overall structure about the proper app
yep
Lollipop?
yep
🤦‍♂ I used Kotlin for the app.
now we use Kotlin
anyways Kotlin is the future for Android Development 😅
😭😭😭😭 I only open android studio and 2/3 gb poof 😭😭😭
What kotlin now?
yeah
*whats
it's like Java
better
Language?
yes
😞 mongoDB doesn't come with any API, we have to implement our own RESTful API with NodeJS
soooooo now we need to split
someone should work on the server side and someone on the android side.
server will use NodeJS+MongoDB and Android will use Kotlin
I made the login and register, but it won't work as we need to know make mongo DB work, also the data needs to be in JSON format.
and and I read mongo is way better than Firebase, only thing with firebase was that the rest APIs were already written for us. here we need to make our own.
Kotlin is way different than Java, it's kinda backwards compatible though Android studio give suggestions to use Functional Programming everywhere.
Kotlin is the future so it's better to use that.
you know what, let's stick with FireBase, because it just works for now. later we can add mongoDB, we'll ask seniors to do that, its a little complex and i want to finish this app and do some other stuff.
just the basic app first.
Ok
Dude u noe how to use raspberry pi with sensors?
Beginner tips?
tutorials on internet is best
and and always use rasbian, any other os doesn't work with the GPIO pins., programming it used Python, should be easy for you.
There r other os’s for raspberry
Dad is using it for his work thing and he’s using Ubuntu mate arm/arch something for raspberry pi
Like is it possible to get the output directly from the gpio pin? Is there code for that?
Instead of going to the sensor company website and getting code from there
I had problems with other OSes
the kernels had problem with working with the GPIO pins
rasbian is official OS and we'll optimised for Pi
so that's more recommended and everything is already setup there
But it is possible to access the gpio pins via code
In raspbian at least
yeah yeah
but I'm not sure about arch/(Ubuntu mate)
because they aren't the official OSes
Arch in the sense not arch Linux, the name had arch and I hv no clue what it means
Thanks man👍🏻
arch is architecture
aarch64 is 64bit and i386 is 32 bit I think.
i386 is 32 bit I’m sure of that
Dude any other light Linux os uk?
Which can run on a core 2 duo
Basically an ancient laptop
Without lag
There's a super light version of Ubuntu with LXDE
and LXDE is very light desktop environment
Debian on LXDE should be pretty good.
pure debian
I've seen people running Mac os mountain lion on core 2 duo
The ancient laptop in question runs Mac something
Lubuntu?
yes
👍🏻
I got temp sensor working with mate
Dint hv any problems
Apart from getting confused with the sensors themselves
awesome l!
!!
👍🏻
movie, tomorrow, Jurassic World !
Vishnavi Sapphire
I can’t come moms not letting
Sorry bro
hmm ohkay
Btw ```su``` doesn’t mean super user it means switch user
Happy bday dude!
Thanks 😄😄😁
Hv fun today!
😂😂 yeah sure
windows is no fun
installing LaTeX
hey I made some YouTube videos about MATLAB
//youtu.be/LFU381e_nys
there are more
take a quick look
need some feedback
It is good
Although more organising could have been done...like in the basics thing why is there plotting? That’s not exactly basic
And 1.1 should’ve been the loops and 1.2 the graphs
but that's what we use commonly
Like step by step
aah ok I can swap those.
True but this is a tutorial rite? So ppl watching it hv no clue what MATLAB is
So slowly introduce stuff
Ur intro could’ve used some work
But other than that everything is pretty good actually
Seriously tho...I’m was wondering why u jumped first to graphs then started teaching loops 😂😂😂
I wasn't going to make a video on loops, thinking that it's too basic
then someone asked me to make it.
BTW did you see ```parfor``
```parfor```
50% better than ```for```
I didn’t  go that far
Weird name
parallel for
uses up all the threads for the loops
Huh? Won’t that hang stuff? Like if all threads r used up then nothing is left
it doesn't.
btw what else do you think one should know for basics ?
Syntax
U covered functions?
How to symbolic expressions
Explanation of inline functions
Conversion between the two
yep
not this though
in plot waala video I talked about inline functions and symbolic function
What other features r there?
Btw I dint ignore u or something since I dint come today
I would’ve come if I could
🤦‍♂ done with thia
*this
//github.com/satyajitghana/RUMSChat
//github.com/satyajitghana/node-rums-chat
and also install a mongoDB server
```node app``` to run this
hmm, i'll have to do the documentations also 🤦‍♂
👍🏻👍🏻
I’ll look into it
now making the user-to-user messages thing.
Users on dif network
yasss
it should work the way I'm thinking
How does it work anyway?
I hv no clue
the user details are sorted in a mongoDB database
to get the data from that database, there's a nodeJS server which in which i've currently made login and register API, so the android app queries using those API's and uses the data sent back by the server
in order to run the complete thing, first run the mongoDB server, then the NodeJS server and then run the Android app
what’s node js?
it's a it's a JavaScript Engine. basically that runs java script code.
Compiler?
can't connect from Android to mongoDB directly, so the NodeJS server.
compiles and runs
Then aren’t u running two servers ?
Wait no
there's only one, the NodeJS server, the mongoDB server is a local server, it should be available to the outside world
*shouldn't
So node js acts like a intermediary between the app and the db
yep
Damn that’s interesting alright
Although I hate react VR
from where did that come in😂
reactVR is awful yep
For some reason node js reminds me of this
Hellllllll
NodeJS is noway related to that.
ReactJS is by Facebook
NodeJS runs on Chrome's V8 engine, i.e. Google
Probably cuz that YouTube guy in VIT recommended learning node js and advised us to us react vr
Sounds like some car engine😂😂😂
😂 not just any car, a engine designed by Google
😂😂😂
Btw why did u hv difficulty with the pi? Like with the sensors and stuff
I never used it with sensors, I used it as a server 😂
as a WiFi router when I didn't have a router
How?
normal Apache server
U get horrible signal with that
one room was enough then
Ya that’s the max
Uk anything abt yocto?
*yocto project
ooh what's that
Custom Linux kernel and stuff for embedded systems
I want ur laptop for that
Ram😭😭😭
but why ?
embedded systems run on very low ram
extremely low
It builds the kernel and other stuff depending on ur preference
Building takings waaaaay too much ram and cpu
Plus I hv to run it on a vm
The build
there must be a cloud build thing which builds it for you
or get a Amazon AWS server, one year free
I’m not too sure abt that tho
so i was thinking, how do we save the messages sent from one user to another ?
this has to be given a thought
designing the DB
then i can make the server part that will handle saving the messages in the DB
after that it should be pretty simple to add that to the client android application
i was thinking how about let's say every conversation will have an id, lets say me and you will have id=1, so every time we talk we will fetch the data from the DB which has id=1, but how do we generate and keep track of the id ?
BTW every data in the mongoDB has a default object id thing, assigned at the time of creation.
basically we need a Database Design for OUR chat system
You deleted this message
i made the repositories private
😂 what if someones steals our code
We should create a chat system
Let each chat be an object of sorts...it’ll have an Id and the convos
But the convos need to be stored in a phone database
They did mention this before
what's a phone database ?
oh you mean local storage ?
Btw ill be going thru android tutorials today so I’ll be able to help in sometime
Ya
I think I remember them taking abt sql
I'm going for a python workshop today in Indiranagar
you wanna come ?
Sql is there in android?
What I’ll do? I learnt python for like 2 years already
don't worry about that. mongoDB is better. and faster.
😂 okeh
I also wrote an android ish app in python for my project, but couldn’t build it for android😅
Stupid thing failed all the time
how's this for now ?
This is same as the previous one u sent
But ya it’s good👍🏻
Menu reminds me of google maps
I want to do something fancy tho...I’ll do it after I learn
fancy UI ?
yeah, this was pretty basic. default themes.
for some reason that previous video doesn't play on android
The thing with this is that I think loading the previous chats will be little harder...it should be seamless so we should implement chunking  of sorts? Like efficient chunking
It played on my phone😂😂😂
Something unique
And minimal👍🏻
the DB can handle like 10000 users search pretty quickly, but we need it to be efficient.
Dunno if the term is called chunking tho...chunking is there for efficient loading of the game world in games but god noes if it’s the same for apps
Ya
where do i store the messages ?
And also we should be able to handle situations like 1000000000 users also
😒😒 yeah, lets overthrow whatsapp and become the leading chat app
😂 let's surprise zuckerberg
Hmm...on the phone and is it possible on the server? Like if the user deletes the app by mistake all his chats r gone
Or implement some back up feature?
Yasssssss
😂😂😂
Back up to google drive
i was thinking send the message from sender -> server -> receiver. i think discord does it this way.
Is it possible?
Ok ya better storing messages on server will take up a lot of space on the server
yep, pretty much
We’ll do this at the last
Like WhatsApp chat backup
but i need a way to identify the conversation, like how do i generate the id for a conversation between two specific people
that would be secondary. we don't even have HTTPS for now, and android complains about it, i suppressed that warning. spent 3 days trying to figure out why the hell it didn't work
Generate random number and check if that number is already an id of a chat and if it is, generate again?
What’s the format of the id?
i donno, you say
Ya let’s finish the basic things first
we can decide
But it has to be unique write?
*right
yeah, and piece of info, all the registration numbers are unique, i set the regNo to be a unique element in the database
Ppls reg num?
Hmm how abt combing the ppls reg number?
It’ll be easier and always unique
yeah, thought it would be better to work with regNos
yeah that's why, though we will have a email verification and to be sure that they are a student of RUAS we will make them use the university email.
the objectId is auto generated by mongoDB when i create a new user
Ok something that tells whether it’s a chat between two students, a student and a faculty or whether it’s a chat between two faculty members...then combine the last three numbers of the two ppls registration number
👍🏻
Like if it’s between u and me, then <something>159178
yeah sure, but first let's make a normal convo between any two people
Or <something>159-178
oh
<something> is something that tells who r the ppl chatting, whether student or factuality
*faculty
So a letter maybe
And the id for both ppl should be same?
chats_id
chats_id will be an array of chat ids
Then one phone should generate the id and send it to the other phone
*chat_ids
Each chat is an object
so everytime the user go to the chats screen, we will query the DB to get the conversations stored in those chat_ids
It’ll be easier to handle
Oh ya correct
Then combine the chats and id as an object so manipulation will be easy
can we convert this to a palindrome so each of the user has the same {chat_id}
The phone which creates the chat should create the id and send it across to the other phone
oh
okay that will do then
N number of unique palindromes...😳
leave, make it simple first then we can make it as much complex as we want
👍🏻
Any good tutorials uk?
😂 I've been watching random YouTuve videos, StackOverflow, Android Studio Wiki page by Google, random other tutorials from medium.com
if we have N users there will be a maximum of N^2 conversations.
oh and I have another project idea, cryptocurrency in our college.
😂 just a idea.
these projects would add to the resumé 😂
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOI😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
That is nice...but canteen ppl will use that?
hmm, we'll have to think about money conversions and stuff.
can you design a unique id generator, because i cant use the regNo directly to save chat_ids, it might pose a security vulnerability, the regNo's are public, anyone can access it, but that unique id will be only accesed by the nodeJS server internally, so lets say 17ETCS002159 wants to chat with 17ETCS002178, then our internal unique id's will be linked together.
chuck that idea, i am not sure a workaround for it now, let's just use the regNo to link chat_ids. we'll figure out something later.
Why don’t u just get the value and then manipulate it to create the chat_id?
Although ya makes sense somewhat
Another thing is that u have to request the server for the other persons ref number to form the id
😑 how did you get through python without pointers, this guy taught python and scared the shit out of me, he was like this object is a pointer to an array of pointers that point to a memory location that stores a value.
C IS THE LANGAUGE OF GOD
*LANGUAGE
Variables in python aren’t “containers” that store values, they point to the values in memory
C IS THE STUPIDEST LANGUAGE IN EXISTENCE
CREATORS OF C ARE LAZY AS HELL
😂😂 say whatever you want
🤣 EVERY LANGUAGE RELIES ON C
yeah "pointers", lots of pointers, pointers here, pointers there. pointers everywhere.
😆 but it was weird that in the workshop, half of the people didn't know OOP, nor C, nor JAVA, but had 5-10 years of work experience
😳
How did they get jobs 😳😳😳
good question 😂
the guy sitting next to me was a technical lead person who codes in python from 7 years
and he didn't know what jupyter notebook was
or anaconda
everyone attending was a uncle to me, and there were two ladies, both with 10 years of experience 😵 😂 I had hoped them to be freshers, but when that organizers asked for people about their experiences i was hiding below my desk
lemme give them 200 bytes of memory in the heap even if they are empty
python is slow as hell and eats up memory like hell
but but human friendly I'll agree
Java is like the middle ground.
😂😂😂😂
The workshop was abt basics?
about internals of python
and some basics
Ohhhh
ok it's done
😝 but now I feel we should switch to flutter.io, since it's cross platform. don't worry about this android code, most of the work is done by the server.
Damn dude nice👍🏻
Umm...won’t that be headache?
I had a talk with Rishabh, well continue when sem. starts, the project is halted for now.
How r u loading the messages? Like if a convo has like 10000000 messages do u load all of them on the screen?
Wow
Akash bhaiyya said that Flutter could be the future, but it's in alpha stage, so I'm not using it. let it get more mature.
yeah. it does like that.
we'll have lazy loading
later.
Ya best don’t
and database can be optimised pretty nicely by using mondoDB shards.
Ya otherwise RAM will die
basically a form of lazy loading for databases. the data is split into different servers and they have data references for knowing where to get the data from.
Data are on dif servers?
Wait make senses...u dint pay for stuff
yeah, distributed data.
I doubt they’ll Give a dedicated server for free
for now it's all there in my lappy 😂
our college won't ?
😐
Mongo ppl
mongo is run on our side, nothing to do with mongo people
Like centralising instead of it being distributed
oh
we'll think about that later
Server DB is what then?
😂 when like we have people who actually use our app.
mongoDB, but it's run on our sever.
I’m pretty sure u need money for that
“Our server” in the sense?
I have a spare PC
we can make that PC into a sever
Oh like that
and we can get a public IP, but for the domain part we have to but a domain.
*buy
I thought u did something similar to cloud stuff or whatever...like the DB is somewhere else not in ur house
😂 or we chuck the public IP, and use the StudentLan to host our server.
its in my laptop.
Getting a lease line for a never changing public ip also required money
cloud would be better, not now.
👍🏻
my ISP will give it to me, he knows me.
Oh😂
He’ll give u a lease line for free?
those guys have plenty of public IPs
no, a public IP for free
Oh
I'll still pay for my connection
like usually I pay
Ya duh
That can’t be free
it used to be for 3 years 😂
because I had admin access to their server
Btw do u noe whether u can identify a sensor that is connected to a pi via code?
now they changed their sever 😐
Good no cheating
yeah maybe, I'm not sure.
How?
no I don't think
not all sensors
This pi thing is taking sometime😓
because basic sensors don't have any logic to differentiate if it's a temp sensor or a moisture sensor
you'll have to know where you put which sensor
Ya point
like there should be a chip in the sensor that returns the sesor details to the pi
Ya exactly
though, UART connected sensors can be identified
like maybe a WiFi module
Uart?
well that's not a sensor
how do you connect your pi to your laptop ?
I don’t I ssh
I use serial connection
Ssh
serial connected devices can be identified
I use multiple pis so I need to ssh
Sensors?
Don’t have so many ports and I don’t want my table to be messy
pin 8 and pin 10 are UART pins
to communicate from laptop to pi
Hey how do I use these pins?
you have a CP2102 or any other USB to TTL converter ?
Umm...what’s that?
you need that to connect a USB connection with the serial p
pin on the pi
I'm selling my old Laptop, a guy just called about that.
so yeah you need a USB to TTY converter
I use a CP2102, cuz I tried others and this one seems to work best
buy it from SP Road or some electronics store maybe
what are you upto exactly 🤔
My uncle needs some temperature and power consumption monitoring in the server room of his company so me, my dad, and couple of his colleagues a doing some IoT soln to that...end goal is to be able to view the temp,etc(along with some graphs and all showing history) on a web browser on ur phone or something
There’s also some vpn stuff happening for communication between the pis and the server but my dads handling that
I’m programming the client and the server stuff
In python so it’s easy thankfully
so where's the problem at ?
😋 the server can be a MEAN Stack server, and make a socket connection between the Pi and the Server, then keep emitting data from the pi to the server, and let the server handle the data.
😂 it's like a chat application between the pi and a sever
Right now, my server just takes the data and writes it into a file
What’s a mean stack?
One way chat
Oh and I’m using udp not tcp
mongoDB, Express, AngularJS, NodeJS
Ohkaay I’ll look into that
Python easy👍🏻
NodeJS and Express take care of the connection, mongo stores the data, AngularJS displays the data in a nice manner in real time
Wait mean stack is all of these?
socket connection uses WSS protocol, it's different.
yeah
Actually...this maybe useful
that's what we used for our app project
WSS?
web socket secured
There’s no need for angular tho
in our project we didn't, maybe at a later stage we might have a web chat thing, maybe.
The server os is centOS
Graphs possible in angular?
yeahhhh, but for graphical stuff I would use p5.js, it makes some coool graphics
👍🏻 I’ll definitely hv to look into it
//satyajitghana.github.io/p5-js/
😁 cool
Thanks 👍🏻
in here look at the music visualizer, and turn off the volume of you want
I'm guessing you need a graph something like the one I've made before.
Github.io?
that's for hosting your GitHub project
for free
What’s normal github then?
Oh wait like a fancy website
Dif ui compared to normal github
I can customise the UI, basically it searches for index.html in my project and loads that
search for "GitHub pages"
Seriously, what song is that?
And it works on iPhone 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
it plays on your phone
😱
damn
On up but still
*obvio
😐 it doesn't play on mine
I get like 6-10fps
Wait seriously?
bollywood re
yeah
It works quite well on safari
//satyajitghana.github.io/ProcessingJS/
Ur phones slow I think then
try the perlin field in here
😂 that will slow you down
see the UI here would be different
Perlinnoisefield and burst paint doesn’t work
Nothing happens
Others work nicely
noise field will take a minute or two to actually see what's happening
Wth
burst paint is tap and hold for the click to work
it should work fine in PC
click to paint is how it was supposed to be in burst paint
And it looks like hair
that's pretty fast 😐
it's a flow field, like a wind thing
Ya it does resemble it
Even u started with i3👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
😁😁 yep
🤦‍♂ took a lot of time to customise it the way I like it to.
Ya same here...waaaay too much time
But it’s amazing once u get used to it
yeah
If u ever find the way to copy and paste from vim to system clipboard, let me noe...google dint help at allllll
use tilix
😂
I think it works
I’m using terminator
I like tilix, more customisable
and easy to customise
No yanking normally copys to vim’s buffer...google says to copy to system clipboard, vim should hv the +clipboard functionality (which default vim on arch doesn’t hv...u have to install gvim) and do “+y...”+y never worked
Ya but it’s too big for me
100+ mb
then you need some kind of vim add-on
there should be
That or figure out how to “+y
Once u start with i3 u use a lot of vim
Atleast for me
I use vim, with VSCode
so never have to worry about clipboard
right click copy works for me
No using mouse
It’s kinda useless in i3 unless ur using gui apps
works in tilix
the only gui app we use is chrome/firefox
I'm using Chrome for now, 🤦‍♂ I had a lot of problems with Firefox
No like the whole idea behind i3 is to not use the mouse so much
???
p5.js doesn't work well
Lol why?
weird glitches
No fix?
yeah there was
switch to chrome they said
😂 V8 engine is better they said
and sounds cooler too
V8 Engine
😂😂😂
Hey for that android app, ur using client-server architecture noe? Not peer to peer
yeah
we could have used peer-to-peer, but I thought client sever was much easier, using a socket connection, and the tutorials I saw for real time communication used sockets and not peer-to-peer, and also because P2P won't work in group chats so client-server was the best option.
Ok
And when u were programming the client server part, did u come across a problem where stuff sent by multiple send calls ended up combining somehow and they get received by one receiving call?
nope, every single call was received by the server. I think you need to do like http long polling or set a timeout. actually NodeJS is asynchronous so the calls cannot get mixed. they all can be recievied at once and processed in parallel.
or maybe you can do like synchronous blocking, so unless the previous call is completely recieved by the server the new call is not sent.
so like a queue.
read about RxPython
I used RxJava and RxAndroid to implement Asynchronous events.
very useful stuff 👍
in Android. and NodeJS as I said already has asynchronality in it.
I don't think they combine, when one call is being recieved it will block any other call sent at the same time. you remember threading in Java, I think they called it demand and supply problem. there we learnt to handle synchronous events.
Lol I’m using simple socket programming😂😂😂
and banging the server with a lot of packets ?
😒 poor server.
custom protocol 😂😂😂
that would be cool thougu
*though
SAA protocol 🤣
Mine isn’t a chat app, data is sent only when required and not always
make one
Ya I googled how to make one...no one said anything
They were like “screw it use this module instead!”
yeah
Rx module.
And I want to send like 3 json objects or 5 at max
For now atleast
actually I used socket.io , it had everything in it. I mean asynchronous stuff.
at once ?
Ya I’m coding stuff
No one by one
why not send it at once ?
wrap them in a list ?
This uses tcp or udp?
that's for handling the event, it can do both tcp and udp.
But if the data is huge even tho it’s 4 objects then it’s kinda stupid...and I don’t like doing that it doesn’t seem nice
you have to tell it what thread to run, and what to do when the thread is completed.
For the app what ur using?
Like which protocol?
and I used an Array to recieve the list of messages.
Array of 200 mb size then?(hypothetically)
for sending and receiving, I use http get and post request.
Oh I’m using python btw
Wait one sec
for messages I use the web sockets. socket.io in particular.
wth ? JSON data that's 200 mb ?
Hypothetical scenario
It took a very long time to find this😂😂😂
Ok I guess In udp u don’t use http
😂 uhh it's a TCP request mostly.
it would be waste of time to implement everything from the lower level if there are frameworks that do it for you. and moreover those frameworks will have more security features as well.
oh right http uses tcp
Yup
Our college rite?
yep
Any prerequisites?
I guess Linux
and C
and Python
what else
Cyber security methods or whatnot?
Well, it is a workshop so maybe not
Although why only 6 ppl?
it's like a trial run
Dude what evaluation?
That group
Sec lab evaluation team
I have no idea
we'll see
Dude where did u do ur internship?
there's a startup company at IIM Bangalore
there
Oh
What’s the company abt?
Ed-Tech
mostly android development
I work on android and firebase cloud.
and a guy who does ML
U finished the app?
oh yeah
wait which app
No not the college one
Tho
oh yeah
*this
search for 1LearnApp
😅 the UI is bad
we don't have any UI/UX designer here.
😂😂😂 no iOS support
Lol then how I’ll search?
Btw have u used arch on ur pi?
nope
android emulator ?
but the install procedure should be same
I want to use it as an access point in my room...how do I do the access point stuff in arch?
aaah i had done that, now I don't remember how I did that.
best would be to google
oh there's a package for that
I don't remember the name of that either
google 😛
🤦🏻‍♂
Any idea what package?
ohkay found it
good thing I write these stuff in a diary
Oh ya I remember that diary
Thanks
yeah np
Btw there’s a good markdown note making app thing called boostnote for Linux...it’s pretty good
oh so do the previous written shit, or just install raspAP
still I prefer hand written for some reason
U can also write code snippets but I haven’t tried that
Ya I get what u mean
code snippets in markdown is like triple this -> `
My dad brought a new router and for some reason my laptops only getting ipv6 address in Manjaro, not ipv4
In windows it works fine
Hein ? that's very weird
very
Ya😭😭😭😭😭😭
ipv4 address comes first
😂😂
oh ok
If I disable ipv6 in the network setting on manjaro, it says cant get up
*ip
that doesn't sound like a router problem, something to do with majaro ofcourse
wait so just to fix that you need to build a router
using a pi
pi is slow when it comes to network IO
😭😭😭😭😭
Whyyyyyy
it wasn't meant for being used as an exclusive router.
it could work
it would work
try raspAP
easy to setup and use
Ya ik but whyyyyy
and comes with a web UI
Why does the network related stuff on my PC always screwy😭😭😭😭😭
*is
What did u do for that company anyway?
all android stuff, and firebase stuff
No like what exactly?
as in ? all sorts of stuff, design the UI, design the database, write code for API's (web)
we built it for "extra learning" like for any topic it would search for YouTube, Google, Wikipedia results and show them, that was one day thing, stuff like this everyday, yesterday it was making a Daily Quiz thing
like we'll have daily quiz for students
mostly these
and then coding the back end of it.
🤦‍♂🤦‍♂ and I also have to do the animations part
that's exhausting
and morever I can't use any libraries, cuz of copyright issues
Damn this sucks
Remember unreal😂😂😂😂😂
🤮🤮🤮
no
I don't want to remember that
we just built and models and rigged them, that's it.
😂
That much itself was hell
yeah I realised i don't like 3D game dev
Programming part is interesting that’s all
yeah
Dude for the college app, the chat part, u used a recycler view rite?
yeah
code's on GitHub
👍🏻
just uploaded another version of the app
or you can use a reverse  LinearLayout
same thing.
I’m still learning
Memory safe? Like if u hv 1000000000 items it’ll load the whole thing to memory?
fetch last 20 messages from server
and if user scrolls up, fetch next 20
havn't implemented that yet
yeah for now.
should be easy though
or save data on local storage and fetch from there.
actually for now it syncs data of local and sever storage
so even if you are offline it should load the data
Either way, I’m doing ui stuff
All this is using normal java? Or some android specific stuff
And this stuff
normal java
Oh ok
ohk
Shawshank 😁😁😁
yeahhhh
//github.com/satyajitghana/University-Work
done with doc.
😂😂😂😂
atleast now use my library
Wow u actually did it😂😂😂
you gave my number to sumanth sir ? 🤔
He asked me
hmm ok, he needed assigments docx
he asked you also ?
Nope
A 3 days trip  to Mangalore is being  organised by our seniors from 28-09-18 to 30-09-18 .The total expenditure will be around 4-6k. If u are interested, dm me or Sanobar. also ask anyone from our class whose not in the group. A head count on the number of ppl is required by tomo morn. Oh and getting attendance on 28 and 29 is not 100% sure for now, so be interested at ur own risk
Wth😂😂😂
Screenshots or no screenshots?
screenshots
3 at maz
*max
No like of the code
yeah
carbon 👍
Ok
small
not too much
What small?
like the amount of code
only the core logic
don't add the codes for small stuff like clear the screen get Text thing and all
Both my labs have 3 functions, I’m carboning the whole function
okay
I'm doing the same
but mine is big
What’s discussion?
explain how you got to those screenshots
like I clicked on 2+2 and then = to get 4
Ok
And in procedure should we tell what all we dragged and dropped and all?
yeah
All my algos fit in one page😂
What comes in conclusion?
😭 1.5 pages
recommendations
to software developer
Recommendations as in? Like if they are doing the same thing how would U advice them?
yeah
limitations also
Did u use PropertyValueFactory or MapValueFactory for putting data in the table?
Any idea which is better?
you can use normal wrapper classes also
actually you don't even have to specify the factory
use the diamond operator
is what netbeans says
ayeeee that uses python to communicate with matlab
😂 I'm fine with live scripts, that's the "legit" way anyways
ohok this is nice
😂 i take it back
though live editor has view as external window option for plots
this doesnt
and no resize
U can specify where to render the graph in jupyter, like in an external window or somewhere else
Live editor doesn’t work for me
Dude for the search field thing, did u get it responsive? Like in mine, when i type something it displays properly, but it doesnt update when I delete the search text...it only updates when I type something...did u hv the same issue?
yeah I had it responsive
any changes in the data is updated on the table
use observable
and callbacks
so whenever there's a data change the callback is fired
you remember the extractor that you saw ? that returned a callback
Nm I got an easier way...whenever there’s a text change, set the predicate
Dunno if it’s good way tho
ohhh
you were asking for the search thing
yeah
that's what i did too
What did u think?
I thought you were asking for data changes in the table
No no
That later
like suppose you increase the number of items then sub-total increases thing
okay
Ya I saw that, u have a spinner rite?
for number of items yes
spinner with edit text, in case you need like 100 items at once
U add a spinner object in the observable list? That’s possible?
yeah
BillItem extends Item and contains a Spinner.
my observable list is BillItem
And normally connecting the list to the table? Nothing different?
yeah
Why dint u use onEditCommit()?
🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ it worked whatever I did
so . . .
didn't look for alternatives
eventually I got what I wanted.
🤦🏻‍♂😂😂😂
I want to see that part of ur code after assignments r over so don’t delete
yeah
GitHub
after assignment submission
😂😂 I did so much work on it I'm not abandoning it
Idiot only🤦🏻‍♂🤦🏻‍♂😂😂😂
Dude how to u set like call this function when increase or decrease spinner? U use onAction?
I use a extractor.
no function calls.
How did u link changes made to an item in the list to reflect on to the table?
Cell Value Factory does it automatically 🤷‍♂
I’ll show in college
U reached?
yeah
How did u add itext?
Maven?
Too many files if u download from sourceforge
If u do use maven, send me a pic of the .pom file, especially the dependencies for itext, I’m getting confused some kernel stuff is there
I downloaded the jar file and added
only download the ones needed
itext-core
itext-layout
What’s ur LD part b first q answer?
huh
howww
You deleted this message
okay I'm not showing you
try again
there's a descrepency
if I tell you then you'll be confused
does this satisfy all the conditions ?
just check this
then I'll tell you what the problem is.
Shubham and I got the same answer
but now Harshith is getting a different one, and it kinda makes sense.
so you try without us telling you what's wrong, if we all three make the same mistake then what we are doing is mostly correct
the problem is can the Tutor enter with C and H ? or does the S have to be with them
Tutor can enter *only if* S is there
But if S is there then anyone can go with him
so can CHT enter ?
H can enter if S is there
So CHT no
H can go with C though
constraint 3
Then why H can go only if S is there?
If HC is possible then only H is also possible
lol, this is even more complicated then
I did this in the truth table
Ya
What does that bank link say?
//www.learnabout-electronics.org/Digital/dig23.php
the english used in the bank one is different
so it does not make confusion
theres no bank in this
The third statement is the confusing one, since it’s says CH is possible but the seconds statement says H can only go with S
yeah, its contradicting
first of all it wasn't supposed to be so complicated
second of all the answer i got was S+HC
the DONT CARE is T
he said there's supposed to be DON'T CARE right
assuming that CH can enter, also CHT can enter.
How is there a don’t care in this?
How?
T is a valid input
U do care about T
T can’t go alone
He’ll go to jail then
If he goes alone
if T can enter or not the value depends on SHC configuration, and not on T
that's why i don't care about T
This is confusing
😂 yeah, pretty much.
there are contradicting sentences in the question
Because if u read the q, it says all other conditions r 0
that "only" thing is confusing
Not don’t care
In the last q says u output is 0 or don’t care
But this q says only 0 otherwise
at the end after simplifying T gets eliminated
but not sure about that constraint
that if CH can enter or if TCH can enter
or should it be ~TCH
What’s ur truth table?
summation (6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15)
I don’t have 7 11 13
Oh ya 7 is HCT
Oops
yeah, if you assume CHT can't enter, and C can't enter without S
Damn it but H has to go with S
Wait a sec T can only go with S not H/C
If u take organisational hierarchy, it makes sense that T can only go with S, he’s just a tutor
Everything except CHT makes sense
S has master key so whoever goes with S can enter
there' another issue, does the question wants a circuit that outputs if people come enter as a group, or should it output if that particular person can enter or now, like if CH are there, H cannot enter since S is not there, but C can enter as H is there.
*not
so if CH come to the entrance at once, both cant enter, only C can
something like that ?
that complicates it even more
That’s even more complicated
Ya
So combination of ppl
like there are conditions if either 1, or 2 or 3 or all 4 can enter
So where S is 1 it’s good
yeah
And HC
Cuz of condition
and sir said it't not complicated 😑
IKR
well it just got complicated
So is HCT possible?
im pretty sure this is what the answer should be
HC is possible then HCT is also possible
It’s like if H and C combine they become S
T can enter only if S is there, so no, and also H can enter if S is there, so only C can enter if all three come at once
if you think in that sense then _they_ can enter
So HCT=(HC)T=ST = 1
😂could we do that ? logically seems right, but it breaks the constraints
two of the constraints
Ik😂😂😂
So answer is this except 7?
Unless this is possible
logically possinle
CH = 1 = S
but contradicts the conditions
question has discrepancy, end of story
Or think of it another way, which ever combination satisfies the conditions (regardless whether there are extra ppl) then that combo is true
That way CHT is true
Or we’ll ask sir on Monday
yeah
that's what i thought at first
then this is the answer
We’ll do this👍🏻
Ya
Because this is how u do the last q
Somewhat
Since >= credits is pass
Not just == credits
yeah
btw did he give the credits
With this I’m getting H as don’t care
Or cancelled whatever
A=S, B=H, C=C, D=T
yeah
same jere
here
perfect
😂 now our job is to tell this answer to everyone
How did u make the hashmap? U hashed they key?
i'm assuming the Key is the Hashed Parameter
only unique keys allowed
i somehow called SIGTSTP
keyboard combination
😱
did you know about ```bg``` and ```fg```
Ya u only found out sometime back in class...ctrl+Z noe?
Background foreground
yeah
🤔🤔🤔 uhh I forgot then
😂😂😂
?
I didn't know, or maybe forgot
Context?
it shows suspended processes
bg
and fg brings them to foreground
okay yeah
yeah yeah
now I figured out how to bring it back to running process
Bash?
yeah
terminal
😳
wait
what were you thinking about ?
Full form😛
For tht gene q in DM, there’s an inbuilt function in python which gives me all the sunsets of a set😂😂😂😂😂
2 lines of code
😂
oh
😂🤣😂 cool
I'll do it in R
so it's not plagiarised
btw I finished plagiarised thingy
But then q is asking to find time complexity...how do u find that for an inbuilt function?
👍🏻👍🏻
I should still start😭😭
😂 good question
you can see the function definition for it noe ?
it should be there
Ya but they won’t give the code only what the thing does
😂😂😂😂
Sahana Maam.vcf (file attached)
Dude for the MIPS walla q in COA assignment
Is it possible to get the MIPS rating as 4.somthing?
not sure
Did u do that q?
nope
Any idea how to do it? I did it but I’m not too sure about the answer
Shubham ?
He also dint do
My answer somewhat makes sense, but 4.something MIPS is kinda low
M3 and COA remains for me
I have APC, DSA and M3
yeah
correct
we all got that
Pakka?
haan
Circuit is huge tho
yeah
yeah
👍🏻
but where's don't care here ?
God noes
I don’t care
sir said there could be don't care
😂 okay
He said maybe
Maybe he mistook god noes
Dude for APC, did u include screenshots of the entire program?
Basically what all screen shots u included in the question
And that appendix thing
no screenshots
copy paste
core logic in documentation
dump full code in appendix
And did u get the eq for math first q?
What answer u got for COA last q?
So u added individual MIPS values and took the time given in the q as the time required to execute 20 instructions or whatever instead of time required to execute 1 instruction
Why though?
yeah
I took total as 1 instruction
No that I got
20% is the frequency means 20% of the time LOAD will take place so 0.2
20% of 1
Why in the sense why add MIPS and why did u take it as time required for x instructions = value in the table?
I tried doing using CPI also
got the same answer
I took time required for one instruction = value in the table
yeah
One instruction of that type
U did this
I took MIPS for one instruction and then got 20% of that
Ayioo see there are 20 load instructions out of 100 noe?
yeah
And they gave execution time is 90 nanoseconds...did u execution time of 20 load instructions as 90 nanoseconds or execution time of 1 load instruction as 90 nanoseconds?
execution time of 1 as 90ns
Then shouldn’t u multiply by 20? Like 90*20 in denominator
U just did 20/90
90ns*10^6 instructions
Formula is like Instruction_count/total execution time of that type right?
yeah
So 20/(20*90*10^-9*10^6)
that's the same as 1/90ns*10^6
Here u did 20/blah blah
so the percentage doesn't matter at all ?
then why was it given
because it cancels out
I dunno...that’s why I took execution time of all types of instructions
even if it's 60% it would still be 0.6/90ns*0.6*10^6
In denominator
then your MIPS must be really low
This
100/((20*90+20*210+10*420+50*200)*10^-9*10^6)
Nope I got 4.9 something
Close to urs
That’s why there’s confusion here
Ya that summation thingy I think
okay then if my total instructions is 1
Keep 100 it’ll be easier to understand
So then which is rite?
this is what you get if you take average CPI
you did 1/(x+y+z) and I did 1/x +1/y +1/z
mine is average mips kind of thing
So which is right?
I'll ask someone
Why did u take all the CPIs with same frequency?
that's CPU frequency it's constant
*calculate all CPIs
not the instruction frequency
Oh
this seems more accurate though
How did cancel CPU freq in MIPS calculation? MIPS formula doesn’t have CPU freq in it
there's another formula for MIPS which is F/CPI*10^6
Some qs in the slide take execution time as CPU time
So CPU time for one Load instruction is 90ns
yeah
so ?
Wait a sec...they used CPI to calculate CPI?
they used individual CPI to calculate average CPI
But my answer using 1/(x+y+z) thing is without the 10^12
?
. . .
Whoops
Wait
Ok it matches my answer
Remove the 10^12 part
4.950495
I solved it using the method they used in that website
yeah same
okay fine we'll take 4.9
👍🏻
and type everything in this way
so it makes sense
Ya
Math 1st q?
For the cipher walla dsa q, u used any data structure?
what's your Model ?
nah normal structures
What’s in the structure?
U did it like cli args specify which file to encrypt/decrypt rite?
yeppol
data
How did u explain this for 4 marks?
I’ll finish DSA and then see
I hate DSA
😂 write some BS that she won't understand
My programs r utter crap
make it complicated
add some BS variables that do nothing
😂 as if she's going to check each line of code
Cipher thing is fine, apart from a struct which does nothing...my plagiarism thingy is very stupid, although it’s less than 100 lines
substring matching ?
yup 🤮🤮🤮
Ya this only, but final answer is weird
damping force _in kilograms_ is numerically equal to 2y'(t)
this sentence doesn't make sense
if it's just numerically equal to 2y'(t) then it's m/s
force ke liye ab usko kg/s se multiply karna hai
Wow ya so according to q m/s = kg
first they say force then kilogram then m/s
all of them have different dimensions
Wait it’s given numerically equal
Chuck all that is this rite?
but it should be kg m/s^2
not sure now
yeah
What did u get?
I'm stuck in the model
because if the model is wrong everything is wrong
U stuck in math😱😱😱😱
😂😂 yeah
Dude what’s ur graph for math first q?
😭 I'm sleepy
Wth, whts ur solutions?
😕
syms y(t)
ode = 8*diff(y, t, 2)+ 5*diff(y, t, 1) + 2*y == (5*(cos(2*t)));
Dy = diff(y, t, 1);
ysol = dsolve(ode, y(0)==0, Dy(0)==0);
t = 0:0.001:5;
z = eval(ysol);
plot(t,z)
hold on
grid on
syms y(t)

Hmm...I dint think of using diff
Solutions tho?
me neither
Pritam solution
No not graph actual solution
I used combo of wolfram and some other math site
Also in the quadrangle there is a poster with the link I think for details
Can u send the link?
8 March 2018 ?
Only the old innovation challenge is there in the normal thing
tomorrow we'll see
Aey that’s last years one but the format won’t change noe?
They do want the whole thing to be broken down into those categories
not sure it might
where are the categories ?
No no categories in the sense the budget, further scope and stuff
Along with the idea, we need to focus on that also
That’s another mistake we did last time
We focused too much on the program and neglected everything else
The themes are there on that poster
Dude this time we r playing to win
So no slacking off
I mean what are the categories for the challenge this time
Same
Take note of this
yeah okay python it is
Oh if u find a nicer looking version of the pdf then send it to me also
I have a different version of it
Which?
Send noe
Apparently recognising breast cancer is easy
so there's no use for us making a program for detecting it ?
From medical point of view
Not programming point of view
lung cancer ?
God noes
see the data set website
whichever has more data set
see if it would be useful
U said breast cancer has most
btw if doctors have problem recognising a type of cancer how would a program recognise it better
yep
Cuz there’s no human error
Wait r u thinking of changing the topic?
let's not do that
what human errors do "doctor" humans have ?
poor eyesight ?
dumb doctors ?
🤔 can we detect breast cancer without a x-ray scan ?
This exists u noe
Hmm I’ll ask
😂😂😂 okay, but don't you have to be qualified to be a doctor in the first place ?
There r some ppl who r doctors and don’t know shit
Example, for colonoscopy kind of operation, which idiot puts the instrument in the patients mouth and expects it to go to the intestine?
This happened in my sis college
okay cool breast cancer it is then
so feature extraction
Ya I’ll talk to my sis when she gets home
Dude where did u get those pics?
Scans walla
Send a clear pic of one now
//www.cancerimagingarchive.net/
its 50 mb files
//dx.doi.org/10.7937/K9/TCIA.2016.7O02S9CY
this is breast cancer data
6671 samples
each of them are 50mb kinda
Dude send a pic of an image
The topic of finding out whether there is cancer or not is very broad
That Wisconsin place got data from a procedure called fine needle aspiration (the images that come up in that process are in shades of pink) and the ones u showed were black and white
uhh those are really big images
you download them
Dude send one pic
I want to show my sis
Use the phone camera
Cuz the Wisconsin stuff is used for waaaaay more specific things not just whether u hv cancer or no
And these are used for simple classification
Which is what we want
this ?
One sec
Ok talked to my sis
She said these things are called mammography and can only tell u whether cancer is there or not
The Wisconsin shit is used for telling what sort of cancer what type specifics which has a looooottttt of medical information
And this is waaaaaay simpler than the Wisconsin thing
She’ll go to the library tomo and get more info on how to read a mammography
oh accha
nice
👍👍👍
I’ll ask someone Ik how u would approach the feature extraction stuff from images
yeah
okay
cool
👍🏻
Found a paper that explains what we want
Feature extraction from mammography
And at the end they also end up classifying it😂
No code, but good starting point
ill send? or did u already come across it?
I didn't search
yeah send
Read the full thing then we’ll discuss what to do, what tools to use, etc
There are stages to it, basically pre-processing, feature extraction and reduction, dumping in a classification algo
This is needed so we both don’t end up doing the same thing and wasting time
And don’t end up using different tools
okay
and we also need non cancerous data for supervised learning
That 160 gb has benign images rite? Benign is non cancerous
it's cancer positives only
ohk I'm not sure
just by looking at these you identified that they are cancerous ?
If it says that even benign thing is there the it’s fine
Sis found out somewhat
it doesn't say
accha
Ok now I want to torture and kill the creator of Realtek
Windows is having problems now
🤬🤬🤬😡😡🤬🤬🤬
😂😂😂 well that's weird
windows never has problems with drivers
No signal in mine
Even when I’m next to the router I get like 1 bar
U read it?
yeah
I'm making a filter for it.
*image filter
and also downloading more sample data
oh and the data I downloaded also shows which part of the image is important. and it has another image with only that part cropped.
so we can detect which area of the image has those "benign" and verify it with the actual area.
probably have to work on GLCM first, which I'm figuring out.
after that we can go for ROI of that processed image
btw that paper also says that plain old neural networks have only 70-75% accuracy.
No no no cropped stuff
What happened to this🤦🏻‍♂
Ok so u do pre-processing I’ll start with the feature stuff and look into it
Btw u forgot about histogram equalisation
isn't that after GLCM ?
it already has it, I cant make it to not download
it downloads everything
More in the sense not the 160 gb one? And this has the cropped stuff?
Wait cropping won’t effect anything rite? It’ll still work even if we put a non-cropped one
yeah
that 160gb data has . . .
so they have a 2 normal mammogram for each patient (left and right) and then a cropped part of the same mammogram. and then a ROI of each mammogram
Despite feeding cropped images for training not effecting anything, we still need to make sure the program works with full fledged images also, cuz that’s our actual inpit
*input
We use tensorflow?
If we r, then I have to use windows...I tried installing tensor flow in manjaro yesterday, manjaro broke
Manjaro broke ? or tensorflow ?
so I was thinking, our NN will take the full images and output a cropped image, and then we can use the given cropped images to verify the output of the NN.
yep, else it will be too slow to process so many images
Why nn? For image processing?
I mean it would work
Manjaro dint boot... I had to install proprietary drivers and cuda support, that broke it
oh yeah it needs some special CudaNN thingy
I was thinking we follow the steps in that paper
well try both
First we’ll go with the paper thingy, cuz the steps are there, then we’ll dig deeper with nn
Provided we have time
Dude give me the link where u got the license keys for clion noe
While installing tensor flow u used Vonda?
*conda
install all this stuff first
then create conda environment
then install tensorflow in that
I’m installing in base
okay
let conda do it then
My q is whether what conda installs and what the website says is the same or what
Cuz I installed the stuff the website said
How did u install it?
I didn't have to, windows. . . .
I just did what the website says
I don't remember I did way back before summer
😂 it's the first thing I did after getting my laptop
I’m installing in windows only
. .
But u used conda rite? Website says to use pip
conda
it said to use conda before
now the website has changed
What’s the code to add 2 numbers using gpu? I want to test and see if it works
x = tf.constant(9,name="x"), y = tf.constant(1,name="y")
sum = tf.add(x, y, name = "sum")

with tf.Session() as sess:
out = sess.run(sum)
print(out)
anything using tf uses GPU session if tensorflow was configured properly
x = tf.constant(9,name="x")
y = tf.constant(1,name="y")
sum = tf.add(x, y, name = "sum")

with tf.Session() as sess:
out = sess.run(sum)
print(out)
comma doesnt work to separate two lines of code in python ?
i thought it did
because it did
oh and import tensorflow as tf
What’s the use of name parameter?
oh you don't need it here
suppose you were doing ML and want to save the output of the tf variables then you need a name
so when you dump them the name that was assigned is dumped
just makes the dump more readable
Oh
It’s taking a while to add
if you don't give a name the variable name is the variable name as in a =tf.costant(..) then 'a' is the name
just loading takes a while
after that it's quicker
the tf session is not used anymore
it was used when I was learning tf
now it's just model.train
that does everything
Which version r u using?
1.11
you ?
1.10
it's backward compatible
Couldn’t install 1.11 using conda
1.11 is beta
Installing using pip dint work
then ?
Dude it’s still running
download the wheel and manual install
try on shell
not on jupyter
Ok
Ok it works in shell
Fast
But Jupyter no
Why?
nope
🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂
yeah
Ok then installing cuda was not required at all
I just ran conda install tensorflow and done
Tensor flow is used only for neural networks??
it's just a framework
you can do anything with it
But can u do stuff like use numpy functions on gpu? Like that Gaussian blur thingy I told u about
Can u execute it using tensorflow? Or should u code the whole thing urself?
if tensorflow has it then yes, I didn't check
Can void pointers point to pointers?
``void**``
```void**```
yep
pointer to pointer to void
😑that day u said single pointer is fine
void pointer pointing to pointers ?
void pointer pointing to array of pointers ?
Say I want a linked list that can hold arrays as well as integers
oh
void**
I used that
But since void can point to anything, can’t it also point to a pointer?
it can
but then you won't know how much depth of pointers you have
it still can though
Ok another q say I have int**, while mallocing, I only have to do malloc(num*sizeof(**int)) rite?
**int
yrp
Both places
yep
Ok
int **
not **int
**int doesn't make sense
**<var_name> in malloc
okay that's fine
Wolfram also gives c=7 but also y=0 and gives the answer in terms of some lambert function
Dude for the “verify the correctness of the derived solution” what should we do?
put values and check
That's it
And plotting ignore any complex parts which come?
Only plot integral values
U won’t get nice graph, it’ll be too pointy
yep
Harvard guys says when m is prime and same in congruence relations, the problem can be solved using linear algebra
No why ?
There's no integral
Just s(50)
Or maybe integral from 0 to 50
Mam wasn't sure
I asked
